- ## Description
  In business design, the concept of "marketing" is understood as the strategic process of identifying, anticipating, and satisfying customer needs and wants, with the ultimate goal of driving profit. This process involves the creation, promotion, and distribution of products or services, and it is a critical component of any successful business model.
  
  Marketing begins with market research to understand the needs, preferences, and behaviors of the target customer segments. This research can involve various methods, such as surveys, interviews, focus groups, or analysis of market trends and consumer data. The insights gained from this research are then used to inform the design and development of products or services that meet the identified customer needs.
  
  Once the product or service is created, the next step in the marketing process is promotion. This involves communicating the value of the product or service to the target customers through various channels, such as advertising, public relations, social media, or direct marketing. The goal of promotion is to raise awareness, generate interest, and stimulate demand for the product or service.
  
  The final step in the marketing process is distribution, which involves getting the product or service into the hands of the customers. This can involve various strategies, such as selling directly to customers through online or physical stores, or using intermediaries like wholesalers or retailers.
  
  An example of marketing in business design could be a company that manufactures eco-friendly cleaning products. The company identifies a growing demand for sustainable products among environmentally-conscious consumers. It designs and develops a range of cleaning products using natural ingredients, and promotes these products through social media and influencer marketing targeting eco-conscious consumers. The company distributes its products through online stores and selected retailers that cater to eco-conscious consumers.
  
  In conclusion, marketing is a vital process in business design that helps companies to identify and satisfy customer needs, create value, and drive business growth. It involves a strategic combination of market research, product or service design, promotion, and distribution, all aimed at meeting the needs and wants of the target customers.

"Customer relationships" describes the types of relationships a company establishes with specific customer segments, which can be driven by a company's marketing strategy. "Channels" refers to how a company communicates and delivers its value proposition to its customer segments, which includes marketing channels.

"Promotion" refers to all the activities that communicate the product or service and its benefits to the customer and persuade them to buy. This includes advertising, PR, sales promotion, personal selling, and direct marketing.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - A SWOT analysis can be used to evaluate a company's marketing strategy by identifying its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in relation to its marketing efforts. This can help a company to leverage its strengths, address its weaknesses, capitalize on opportunities, and mitigate threats.
