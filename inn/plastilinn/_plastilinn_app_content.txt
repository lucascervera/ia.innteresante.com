innBoK\artifacts\profile-(id)___quantified-value-proposition___examples___Space X.md
          - It is widely recognized that Space X's reusable rocket technology has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of launching payloads into space.
           By recovering and reusing rocket boosters, Space X aims to decrease launch costs by eliminating the need to build new rockets for each mission.
           This approach has already demonstrated cost savings compared to traditional expendable rockets.
           Let's consider a scenario where a traditional expendable rocket launch costs $100 million for a specific payload.
           Now, imagine that Space X's reusable rocket technology allows for a cost reduction of 30% per launch due to the reuse of the rocket's first stage.
           In this example, if Space X were to launch the same payload using their reusable rocket system, the cost savings would amount to $30 million per launch.
           This significant reduction in launch costs can have a substantial impact on the overall budget of space agencies, allowing for more frequent launches, additional missions, or the allocation of resources to other critical areas.

  - The company behind the Vein Viewer, an innovative medical device, developed a business model that focuses on addressing the medical needs of patients and the clinical workforce.
   The Vein Viewer is designed to locate veins in patients, especially in cases where it's challenging due to obesity or other factors. This is known as difficult venous access (DVA).
   The device is particularly useful in reducing the pain and complications that patients experience during needle sticks for vascular access.
   One of the significant innovations of the Vein Viewer is its high-definition imaging and advanced digital full field technology.
   It uses a reflective, infrared technology, emitting harmless LED light, which is absorbed by the blood and reflected by surrounding tissues.
   This technology allows medical professionals to easily locate veins, understanding the patient's blood pattern up to 15 mm deep, with 10 mm being sufficient for medical purposes.
   It prevents patients from receiving accidental punctures during attempts to find veins and projects an image of the patient’s vasculature with exact anatomical locations.
   This not only ensures a safer procedure of vascular access for patients and healthcare workers but also represents a significant advancement in medical science.
   For the business model, the company used the Business Model Canvas as a tool for launching the Vein Viewer Flex to the market.
   The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management tool that provides a visual framework for developing, describing, and analyzing a company's business model, including key partners, activities, resources, value propositions, customer relationships, channels, customer segments, cost structure, and revenue streams.
   This tool was chosen for its capability to manage multiple aspects of model development in a well-structured manner​1​.

- ## Definition
  - A business is an organization or entity that provides goods or services in exchange for profit or revenue.
- ## Content type ()
  - Content is of type text.
  
- ## Description
  The concept of "My Business" in business modeling refers to the personalized and unique approach to designing and managing a business model. This concept emphasizes the importance of tailoring the business model to the specific needs, goals, and context of the business, rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach.
  
  In the "My Business" model, the business owner or management team takes into account the unique characteristics of the business, such as its size, industry, target market, resources, and competitive environment. They then design a business model that is best suited to these characteristics and that will enable the business to achieve its objectives.
  
  For example, a small, locally-owned coffee shop ("My Business") would have a very different business model than a large, multinational coffee chain. The coffee shop might focus on providing a personalized customer experience, sourcing local ingredients, and building strong relationships with the local community. Its business model might include a small, dedicated team, a single location, and a focus on quality over quantity.
  
  On the other hand, the multinational coffee chain would likely have a business model focused on scalability, efficiency, and brand consistency. Its business model might include multiple locations, a large workforce, standardized products and processes, and a strong emphasis on marketing and brand recognition.
  
  The "My Business" concept in business modeling is crucial because it recognizes that each business is unique and that its business model should reflect this uniqueness. It encourages business owners and managers to think critically about what makes their business unique and how they can leverage these unique characteristics to create a successful and sustainable business model.

  - A business idea refers to a unique concept or proposition that forms the foundation of a business model.
- ## Content type ()
  - Content is of type text.
  
- ## Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "business idea" refers to the initial concept or thought that forms the basis for a potential business venture. It is the seed from which a business can grow, encompassing the product or service that the business will offer, the target market, and the unique selling proposition that will differentiate the business from its competitors.
  
  The business idea is a critical component of a business model as it lays the foundation for all subsequent planning and strategy development. It is the starting point for the design of the business, providing the initial vision that guides the development of the business model, strategy, and operations.
  
  For example, the business idea for a tech startup might be "to develop a mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to help individuals manage their personal finances." This idea outlines the product (the mobile app), the target market (individuals needing help with personal finance), and the unique selling proposition (the use of artificial intelligence).
  
  In essence, the concept of "business idea" in business modeling is about identifying and articulating the initial concept that forms the basis for a potential business. It is a crucial element in business design, providing the initial vision and direction for the business, and shaping the development of the business model, strategy, and operations.

  - [[Lean Startup Methodology]]
    - The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, is built around the concept of developing a business idea through a process of validated learning. This involves quickly building a minimum viable product (MVP) based on the business idea, measuring how it performs in the market, and learning from that data to iterate and improve the product.
  - [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
    - The Blue Ocean Strategy, developed by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, is a business model that focuses on creating new demand in an uncontested market space, or "Blue Ocean", rather than competing in an existing market. The business idea is the unique concept or proposition that allows the company to create this new market space.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - The Value Proposition Canvas, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is a tool that helps businesses to design compelling value propositions that customers will love. The business idea is the unique concept or proposition that forms the basis of the value proposition.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The SWOT analysis can be used to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to a business idea. This can help to identify potential challenges and opportunities for the business idea in the market.

  - An opportunity is a potential area for a business to generate revenue or create value for customers within its business model.
- ## Content type ()
  - Content is of type text.
  
- ## Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "opportunity" refers to a set of circumstances that makes it possible for a business to achieve specific, strategic goals. Opportunities can arise from a variety of sources, such as changes in market trends, technological advancements, shifts in customer needs or behaviors, or regulatory changes. 
  
  Opportunities are a crucial component of a business model as they provide the basis for the creation of value. They represent potential avenues for growth and profitability, and they guide the strategic decisions that a business makes in terms of its products, services, operations, and market positioning. 
  
  For example, a software company might identify an opportunity in the growing demand for remote work solutions. This opportunity could guide the company's product development efforts, leading to the creation of a new software solution that enables efficient remote collaboration. 
  
  In essence, the concept of "opportunity" in business modeling is about identifying and capitalizing on the potential for growth and value creation. It is a critical element in business design, driving strategic decision-making, innovation, and competitive positioning. It shapes the business's strategies for product development, market entry, customer engagement, and revenue generation.

- ## Description
  In business modeling, "business status" refers to the current position or condition of a company in terms of its financial health, operational efficiency, market position, and overall performance. It is a snapshot of the company's situation at a particular point in time, providing a basis for decision-making, planning, and strategy development. Business status is a crucial component of a business model as it provides the context in which the company operates and influences its strategic choices and actions.
  
  A business status typically includes the following elements:
  
  - Financial Performance: This refers to the company's financial results, such as revenue, profit, cash flow, and return on investment. It provides an indication of the company's profitability and financial stability.
  
  - Operational Efficiency: This involves the company's operational metrics, such as productivity, quality, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. It reflects the effectiveness of the company's operations and processes.
  
  - Market Position: This relates to the company's standing in the market, including its market share, competitive position, and brand reputation. It shows the company's relative strength or weakness in the marketplace.
  
  - Organizational Health: This includes factors such as employee engagement, leadership effectiveness, culture, and innovation. It provides insights into the company's internal environment and its capacity for change and growth.
  
  For example, a company's business status might show that it has strong financial performance, high operational efficiency, a leading market position, and a healthy organizational culture. This status would suggest that the company is in a strong position to pursue aggressive growth strategies, invest in new opportunities, and withstand competitive pressures. On the other hand, if the company's business status reveals financial difficulties, operational problems, a weak market position, or organizational issues, it might need to focus on turnaround strategies, cost reduction, process improvement, or organizational change.

- ## Description
  In business modeling, "challenges" refer to the obstacles or difficulties that a business may encounter in its journey to achieve its goals. These can range from internal issues such as operational inefficiencies, lack of resources, or skill gaps, to external factors like market competition, regulatory changes, or economic downturns. 
  
  Challenges are an integral part of business design as they test the resilience and adaptability of a business model. They force businesses to critically analyze their strategies, processes, and resources, and make necessary adjustments to overcome the hurdles. This process of problem-solving and continuous improvement often leads to the development of more robust and sustainable business models.
  
  For example, a business may face the challenge of declining sales due to increasing competition in the market. To overcome this, the business may need to redesign its value proposition, improve its product or service quality, or adopt innovative marketing strategies. 
  
  However, it's important to note that challenges should not be viewed merely as problems, but as opportunities for growth and innovation. They provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of a business, and can serve as catalysts for change and transformation. 
  
  In essence, challenges are the stepping stones to business success. They push businesses to step out of their comfort zones, embrace change, and strive for excellence. They are what drive businesses to continuously evolve, innovate, and create value in the face of adversity.

- ## Description
  In business modeling, "inspiration" refers to the creative and innovative ideas that drive the formation and evolution of a business. It is the spark that ignites the entrepreneurial spirit, leading to the development of new products, services, or business models. Inspiration can come from various sources, such as market trends, customer needs, technological advancements, or even societal changes.
  
  Inspiration is a crucial aspect of business design as it fuels the ideation process, leading to the creation of unique and competitive value propositions. It encourages businesses to think outside the box, challenge the status quo, and strive for continuous improvement. 
  
  For example, a business may be inspired by the growing trend of sustainability and environmental consciousness among consumers. This inspiration could lead the business to design and launch a new line of eco-friendly products, thereby meeting customer needs, differentiating itself from competitors, and contributing to environmental sustainability.
  
  However, it's important to note that inspiration alone is not enough. It must be coupled with rigorous market research, strategic planning, and effective execution to translate innovative ideas into successful business ventures. 
  
  In essence, inspiration is the catalyst for business innovation and growth. It is what drives entrepreneurs to take risks, push boundaries, and create value for their customers, stakeholders, and society at large.

  - Content is of type text.
  
- ## Description
  The concept of "Unfair Advantage" in business modeling refers to a unique benefit or set of benefits that a business possesses, which allows it to outperform its competitors. This could be anything from proprietary technology, exclusive partnerships, superior talent, or access to scarce resources. The key aspect of an unfair advantage is that it is not easily replicable or attainable by competitors, making it a powerful competitive edge.
  
  In the "Unfair Advantage" model, the business leverages its unique advantages to create superior value for its customers and/or operate more efficiently than its competitors. This could involve using proprietary technology to offer a better product, leveraging exclusive partnerships to access markets or resources that competitors can't, or utilizing superior talent to provide exceptional service.
  
  For example, a tech startup might have an unfair advantage in the form of a proprietary algorithm that allows it to offer a more effective solution than its competitors. This unfair advantage enables the startup to attract more customers and generate higher revenues, even if it's a smaller company with fewer resources.
  
  Alternatively, a manufacturing company might have an unfair advantage in the form of an exclusive partnership with a key supplier. This allows the company to access high-quality materials at a lower cost than its competitors, enabling it to produce superior products and/or offer more competitive prices.
  
  The "Unfair Advantage" concept in business modeling is crucial because it emphasizes the importance of leveraging unique benefits to achieve competitive superiority. It encourages businesses to identify, cultivate, and exploit their unique advantages to outperform their competitors and achieve greater success.

- ## Description
  In business modeling, "strategy" refers to the high-level plan and approach a company takes to achieve its goals and objectives in the face of competition. It is the blueprint that guides the company's decisions and actions, aligning them with its mission, vision, and values. Strategy is a critical component of a business model as it defines the direction and scope of the organization over the long term.
  
  A business strategy typically includes the following elements:
  
  - Strategic Objectives: These are the specific, measurable goals that the company aims to achieve. They provide a clear direction and focus for the organization.
  
  - Competitive Advantage: This refers to the unique value proposition that sets the company apart from its competitors. It could be based on factors such as cost, quality, innovation, customer service, or brand reputation.
  
  - Resource Allocation: A strategy outlines how the company will allocate its resources (such as time, money, and personnel) to achieve its objectives. This includes decisions about investments, budgeting, and staffing.
  
  - Risk Management: A strategy also involves identifying potential risks and challenges and developing plans to mitigate them. This could include market risks, operational risks, financial risks, and more.
  
  For example, a company's strategy might be to become the market leader in its industry by offering innovative, high-quality products, investing heavily in research and development, building a strong brand, and providing exceptional customer service. This strategy would guide the company's decisions about product development, marketing, sales, customer service, and other key areas.

  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, the "strategy" is not explicitly defined as a separate component, but it is inherently present in all nine components. The strategy is reflected in how these components interact and align to create and deliver value. For example, the value proposition, customer segments, channels, customer relationships, key activities, key resources, key partnerships, cost structure, and revenue streams all need to be strategically aligned to ensure the business model's success.
  - [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
    - This strategic planning tool, developed by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, is all about creating uncontested market space (i.e., a "blue ocean") and making the competition irrelevant. The strategy here involves simultaneously pursuing differentiation and low cost to open up a new market space and create new demand.
  - [[Porter's Five Forces]]
    - This tool, developed by Michael E. Porter, is used to analyze the competitive environment of a business. The strategy here involves understanding the five forces (competition in the industry, potential of new entrants into the industry, power of suppliers, power of customers, and threat of substitute products) and positioning the company in a way that it can gain competitive advantage.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool used to identify and analyze a company's internal strengths and weaknesses, and its external opportunities and threats. The strategy here involves leveraging the company's strengths and opportunities, and addressing its weaknesses and threats to achieve its goals and objectives.
  - [[Balanced Scorecard]]
    - This strategic planning and management system is used to align business activities with the vision and strategy of the organization, improve internal and external communications, and monitor organization performance against strategic goals. The strategy here involves balancing financial measures with measures of customer satisfaction, internal processes, and the organization's ability to learn and improve.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - The PESTEL analysis is a tool used to analyze the external macro-environmental factors that affect an organization. The strategy here involves understanding how these factors (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal) impact the business and adjusting the business model and strategy accordingly.

- ## Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "organization values" refers to the core principles or standards that guide a company's actions and decisions. These values are deeply ingrained in the company's culture and serve as a compass for its behavior, shaping its interactions with stakeholders, its approach to business, and its overall identity.
  
  Organization values are a critical component of a business model because they define what the company stands for and what it believes in. They influence every aspect of the business, from its mission and vision to its strategies and operations. They also play a key role in attracting and retaining employees, customers, and partners who share the same values.
  
  For example, a company might have organization values centered around innovation, customer satisfaction, and social responsibility. These values would guide the company's actions and decisions, leading it to invest in research and development, prioritize customer needs, and engage in sustainable practices.
  
  In essence, the concept of "organization values" in business modeling is about defining and embodying the principles that drive a company's actions and decisions. It is a fundamental element in business design, shaping the company's culture, strategy, and brand identity. It influences how the company is perceived by its stakeholders and how it contributes to society at large.

  - [[Corporate Culture Health Check]]
    - This tool, developed by Denison Consulting, assesses the alignment of an organization's values with its practices. It measures four key traits: adaptability, mission, involvement, and consistency. The latter directly relates to the organization's values, as it measures the extent to which the organization's behavior is consistent with its stated values.
  
  - [[Balanced Scorecard]]
    - The Balanced Scorecard, developed by Robert Kaplan and David Norton, is a strategic planning and management system that organizations use to align business activities with the vision and strategy of the organization, improve internal and external communications, and monitor organization performance against strategic goals. The scorecard includes financial measures that tell the results of actions already taken. And it complements the financial measures with operational measures on customer satisfaction, internal processes, and the organization's innovation and improvement activities—operational measures that are the drivers of future financial performance.
  
  - [[Cultural Web]]
    - The Cultural Web, developed by Gerry Johnson and Kevan Scholes, is a model that represents the behavioral, physical, and symbolic manifestations of a culture that can help to identify the organization's culture. One of the six components of the Cultural Web is 'Rituals and Routines', which are the daily behavior and actions of people that signal acceptable behavior. This influences what is expected to happen in given situations, and what is valued by management.
  
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - The Value Proposition Canvas, developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is a tool that helps organizations ensure that their products or services are positioned around what the customer values and needs. The 'Customer Profile' section of the canvas helps organizations to understand customer needs and whether the organization's values align with these needs.
  
  - [[McKinsey 7S Framework]]
    - The McKinsey 7S Framework, developed by Tom Peters and Robert Waterman at McKinsey & Company, is a model that analyzes seven key elements of an organization to determine how well they are aligned and how they can be improved.

- ## Description
  In business modeling, "organization goals" refer to the strategic objectives that a company aims to achieve over a specific period. These goals provide direction, facilitate planning, guide decision-making, and serve as a benchmark for evaluating performance. They are a critical component of a business model as they define the company's purpose, drive its activities, and shape its strategies.
  
  Organization goals typically encompass the following aspects:
  
  - Financial Goals: These relate to the financial outcomes that the company seeks to achieve, such as revenue growth, profit margin improvement, cost reduction, and return on investment. They reflect the company's financial aspirations and its commitment to delivering value to shareholders.
  
  - Operational Goals: These pertain to the operational results that the company aims to attain, such as enhancing productivity, improving quality, increasing efficiency, and boosting customer satisfaction. They demonstrate the company's focus on operational excellence and process optimization.
  
  - Market Goals: These involve the market positions that the company strives to reach, such as gaining market share, entering new markets, strengthening competitive position, and building brand reputation. They indicate the company's ambition to grow, compete, and succeed in the marketplace.
  
  - Organizational Goals: These include the organizational outcomes that the company desires to realize, such as developing leadership, fostering innovation, promoting a positive culture, and enhancing employee engagement. They signify the company's dedication to creating a conducive work environment, nurturing talent, and fostering organizational health.
  
  For instance, an organization's goals might include increasing revenue by 20%, reducing operational costs by 10%, expanding to two new markets, and improving employee engagement by 15%. These goals would guide the company's strategies, decisions, and actions, and provide a standard for measuring its performance. If the company achieves these goals, it would indicate that it is successful in executing its business model and creating value. Conversely, if the company falls short of these goals, it would suggest that it needs to reassess its business model, strategies, or execution.

- ## Description
  In business modeling, "stakeholders" refer to any individual, group, or organization that has an interest in, or is affected by, the activities and outcomes of a business. Stakeholders can be internal or external to the business, and their interests and influence can vary significantly. 
  
  - Internal Stakeholders: These are individuals or groups within the organization, such as employees, managers, and shareholders. They are directly involved in the operations and decision-making processes of the business. Their interests typically revolve around job security, profitability, and the growth and success of the business.
  
  - External Stakeholders: These are individuals or groups outside of the organization that are affected by its activities. They can include customers, suppliers, investors, competitors, government agencies, and the community at large. Their interests can range from product quality and customer service to environmental impact and corporate social responsibility.
  
  Stakeholder modeling is a crucial aspect of business design as it helps identify the needs, expectations, and potential conflicts of various stakeholders. This understanding can then be used to develop strategies and make decisions that balance these diverse interests. 
  
  For example, a business may need to balance the interests of shareholders seeking higher profits with those of local community groups advocating for environmental sustainability. By understanding and considering the perspectives of both these stakeholders, the business can develop a strategy that maximizes profitability while also demonstrating a commitment to environmental responsibility. 
  
  In essence, stakeholders are a fundamental part of any business model, and their engagement and satisfaction are key to the long-term success and sustainability of a business.

- ## Description
  In business modeling, a "segment list" refers to the categorization of a company's market into distinct subsets of consumers with common needs, characteristics, or behaviors. These segments can be defined based on various factors such as demographic, geographic, psychographic, and behavioral traits. 
  
  The segment list is a crucial component of business design as it helps businesses to better understand their target audience, tailor their products or services to meet specific customer needs, and develop targeted marketing strategies. It enables businesses to focus their resources on the most profitable segments, thereby maximizing their return on investment.
  
  For example, a clothing retailer may segment its market based on age groups, fashion preferences, and income levels. Each segment will have different needs and preferences, and therefore, will require different products and marketing approaches. The retailer may offer trendy and affordable clothing for the younger segment, high-end designer wear for the affluent segment, and classic and comfortable clothing for the older segment. 
  
  By understanding the unique needs and preferences of each segment, the retailer can design products that resonate with its target customers, create marketing messages that appeal to them, and deliver a shopping experience that meets their expectations. 
  
  In essence, a segment list is a powerful tool that enables businesses to create value for their customers, differentiate themselves from their competitors, and achieve sustainable growth. It is the foundation of customer-centric business design and a key driver of business success.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Segment (ID)" in business modeling refers to the identification and categorization of different groups within a market, based on specific characteristics or behaviors. These segments can be defined by a variety of factors, such as demographic information, geographic location, psychographic traits, or behavioral patterns. The key aspect of a segment (ID) is that it allows businesses to tailor their products, services, and marketing strategies to meet the specific needs and preferences of different groups within their target market.
  
  In the "Segment (ID)" model, the business uses data and analytics to identify distinct groups within its market, understand their unique needs and behaviors, and develop targeted strategies to engage and serve them. This could involve creating different versions of a product to cater to the needs of different segments, or developing personalized marketing campaigns that resonate with specific groups.
  
  For example, a fashion retailer might identify different segments within its market based on factors like age, gender, and fashion preferences. It could then create different clothing lines to cater to the needs of each segment, and develop targeted marketing campaigns that appeal to the specific tastes and preferences of each group.
  
  Alternatively, a software company might identify different segments based on the size and type of businesses it serves. It could then develop different versions of its software to meet the specific needs of small businesses, large corporations, and different industries.
  
  The "Segment (ID)" concept in business modeling is crucial because it emphasizes the importance of understanding and catering to the diverse needs and preferences of different groups within a market. It encourages businesses to use data and analytics to identify and understand their target segments, and to develop targeted strategies to engage and serve them effectively. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, business success.

- ## Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "segment" or "segmentation criteria" refers to the process of dividing a company's market into distinct groups of buyers who might require separate products or marketing mixes. These groups, or segments, are defined by shared characteristics such as demographics, behaviors, needs, or preferences. The purpose of segmentation is to allow a company to better tailor its products, services, and marketing efforts to meet the specific needs of different customer groups.
  
  Segmentation criteria can be based on a wide range of factors, including age, gender, income, location, lifestyle, buying behavior, and more. The chosen criteria should be relevant to the product or service being offered, and should effectively differentiate different groups of customers.
  
  For example, a clothing retailer might segment its market based on age and gender, offering different product lines for men, women, and children. Within these broad segments, the retailer might further segment based on factors like fashion style or price sensitivity, offering different ranges for customers who prefer classic versus trendy styles, or budget versus premium pricing.
  
  In essence, the concept of "segment" or "segmentation criteria" in business modeling is about understanding and categorizing the diverse needs and preferences of a company's customer base. This allows the company to more effectively target its offerings and marketing efforts, improving customer satisfaction and business performance. It is a critical element in business design, shaping the development of a company's products, services, and marketing strategies.

  In business modeling, the concept of "segment (id)/market size" refers to the identification and quantification of a specific group of potential customers within a market that a company aims to reach with its products or services. This segment is typically defined by certain characteristics such as age, income, geography, or behavior, which the company believes will make these customers more likely to purchase its offerings.
  
  The market size, on the other hand, is the total number of potential customers or the total revenue potential within the identified segment. It provides an estimate of the maximum potential that a business can hope to achieve if it were to capture the entire market segment.
  
  For example, a company that produces organic baby food might identify its market segment as health-conscious parents of infants and toddlers. The market size would then be determined by the total number of such parents, or alternatively, the total amount they spend on baby food annually.
  
  The concept of "segment (id)/market size" is crucial in business modeling as it helps a company to focus its resources on the most promising customers, tailor its offerings to meet their specific needs, and estimate the potential revenue it can generate. It is a fundamental aspect of business design, shaping the company's marketing strategy, product development, and overall business strategy. It influences how the company positions itself in the market, competes with other businesses, and achieves its financial goals.

  In business modeling, "Segment (ID)/Market Trends" refers to the identification and analysis of specific portions of a market (segments) and the prevailing patterns of change (trends) within these segments. This concept is crucial in a business model as it helps companies understand their target customers, competitors, and market dynamics, and formulate effective strategies.
  
  Segment ID typically involves the following aspects:
  
  - Customer Segmentation: This involves dividing a market into distinct groups of customers based on their needs, preferences, behaviors, or characteristics. For example, a company might segment its market by age, income, lifestyle, geography, or buying behavior. This allows the company to target specific customer groups with tailored products, services, or marketing messages.
  
  - Competitive Segmentation: This involves categorizing competitors based on their strengths, weaknesses, strategies, or market positions. For instance, a company might segment its competitors by size, product range, pricing strategy, or market share. This enables the company to understand its competitive landscape and devise effective competitive strategies.
  
  Market Trends typically encompass the following aspects:
  
  - Demand Trends: These relate to the patterns of change in customer demand for a product or service. For example, a company might analyze trends in customer needs, preferences, or buying behaviors. This helps the company anticipate changes in demand and adjust its offerings or strategies accordingly.
  
  - Supply Trends: These pertain to the patterns of change in the supply of a product or service. For instance, a company might examine trends in production costs, technological advancements, or regulatory changes. This allows the company to foresee changes in supply and modify its operations or strategies as needed.
  
  - Competitive Trends: These involve the patterns of change in the competitive environment. For example, a company might track trends in competitor activities, market shares, or entry/exit of competitors. This enables the company to predict competitive shifts and adapt its competitive strategies accordingly.
  
  For instance, a company might identify a segment of health-conscious consumers who prefer organic products and notice a trend of increasing demand for organic food. Based on this, the company might decide to launch a new line of organic products to target this segment and capitalize on this trend. This would demonstrate the company's ability to leverage its understanding of Segment (ID)/Market Trends to drive its business model and create value.

  In business modeling, the concept of "segment (id)/partners" refers to the identification and categorization of a company's strategic partners based on their specific roles, contributions, and relationships with the company. These partners can be individuals, businesses, or organizations that contribute to the company's value creation, delivery, and capture processes.
  
  The segment (id)/partners is a critical component of business design as it helps businesses to identify and manage their key partnerships, leverage their resources and capabilities, and create synergies. It enables businesses to focus on their core competencies, outsource non-core activities, reduce costs, and increase efficiency.
  
  For example, a tech startup may segment its partners into technology providers, distribution partners, and investors. Technology providers supply the necessary hardware and software, distribution partners help to bring the product to the market, and investors provide the necessary capital. Each partner plays a different role and contributes to the startup's success in different ways.
  
  By understanding the unique roles and contributions of each partner, the startup can manage its partnerships more effectively, align its interests with those of its partners, and create win-win relationships. It can leverage its partners' resources and capabilities to enhance its value proposition, reach more customers, and scale its business.
  
  In essence, the segment (id)/partners is a strategic tool that enables businesses to build and manage their ecosystem, create and deliver value more effectively, and achieve competitive advantage.

  The concept of "Competition" in business modeling refers to the analysis and understanding of other businesses that offer similar products or services in the same market. This involves identifying who these competitors are, understanding their strategies, strengths, and weaknesses, and determining how they could potentially impact your business.
  
  In the "Competition" model, businesses use various tools and techniques to gather and analyze information about their competitors. This could involve conducting market research, analyzing competitors' marketing strategies, assessing their product offerings, and monitoring their pricing strategies. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the competitive landscape and to identify opportunities and threats.
  
  For example, a new restaurant might analyze the competition in its local area to understand what types of cuisine are already being offered, what price points are common, and what unique selling propositions other restaurants are promoting. This information could then be used to develop a unique and competitive business model that fills a gap in the market.
  
  Alternatively, a tech startup might analyze the competition in its industry to understand the key features and benefits of competing products, the marketing strategies being used, and the overall market share of different competitors. This information could then be used to develop a product that offers unique features or benefits, or to create a marketing strategy that differentiates the startup from its competitors.
  
  The "Competition" concept in business modeling is crucial because it helps businesses to understand the competitive landscape and to develop strategies that will allow them to compete effectively. This can lead to increased market share, customer loyalty, and ultimately, business success.

  In business modeling, "segment (id)/roles" refers to the categorization of different groups within a business model based on their specific roles or functions. This concept is crucial in understanding the dynamics of a business and how different segments interact with each other and contribute to the overall functioning of the business.
  
  - Segment (id): This refers to the different divisions or departments within a business. Each segment has its own unique identity and role within the organization. For example, in a manufacturing company, segments could include production, marketing, sales, and customer service. Each of these segments has a specific role and contributes to the overall success of the business in different ways.
  
  - Roles: Within each segment, individuals or groups are assigned specific roles based on their skills, expertise, and the needs of the business. These roles define the responsibilities and tasks that each individual or group is expected to perform. For example, in the marketing segment, roles could include market research, advertising, public relations, and digital marketing.
  
  The concept of segment (id)/roles is essential in business design as it helps in organizing the business structure, defining responsibilities, and ensuring that all necessary functions are covered. It also aids in identifying potential gaps or overlaps in roles, which can then be addressed to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
  
  For example, a business may identify that the role of digital marketing is not being adequately covered within the marketing segment. This could lead to the creation of a new role or the expansion of an existing role to ensure that this function is effectively managed.
  
  In essence, the concept of segment (id)/roles is a fundamental aspect of business modeling, providing a clear structure and direction for the organization and contributing to its overall success and sustainability.

  The concept of "segment (id)/profiles" in business modeling refers to the identification and characterization of distinct groups within a company's market, based on shared characteristics or behaviors. These profiles are created after the segmentation process and provide a more detailed understanding of each segment.
  
  Segment profiles can include a wide range of information, such as demographic details, buying behaviors, needs, preferences, lifestyle characteristics, and more. The goal is to create a comprehensive picture of each segment, which can then be used to tailor products, services, and marketing efforts to meet the specific needs and preferences of each group.
  
  For instance, a car manufacturer might identify a segment of customers who are environmentally conscious and prefer electric vehicles. The profile for this segment might include details such as average age, income level, common values (such as sustainability), and typical buying behaviors (such as a willingness to pay a premium for eco-friendly products). This profile would then inform the development of products and marketing strategies targeted specifically at this group.
  
  In essence, the concept of "segment (id)/profiles" in business modeling is about creating detailed portraits of each customer group, based on shared characteristics and behaviors. This allows a company to better understand its customers and tailor its offerings and marketing efforts accordingly, leading to improved customer satisfaction and business performance. It is a key component of business design, informing the development of a company's products, services, and marketing strategies.

- ## Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "profile list" refers to a detailed and organized collection of specific characteristics, behaviors, or attributes that define a particular group of customers, users, or stakeholders. This list is used to create a comprehensive understanding of the target audience, their needs, preferences, and how they interact with a product or service.
  
  The profile list can include a wide range of information such as demographic details (age, gender, income, etc.), psychographic characteristics (interests, attitudes, values, etc.), behavioral patterns (purchasing habits, brand loyalty, etc.), and other relevant attributes. 
  
  For instance, a company that offers online language learning courses might have a profile list that includes characteristics such as age, native language, learning goals (e.g., travel, business, academic), preferred learning style (e.g., visual, auditory, kinesthetic), and technological proficiency. 
  
  The concept of "profile list" is essential in business modeling as it allows a company to segment its market, tailor its products or services to meet the specific needs of different customer groups, and develop targeted marketing strategies. It provides valuable insights that can drive product development, customer service, sales, and other key business functions. By understanding who their customers are and what they want, companies can design and deliver offerings that meet their customers' needs and expectations, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction, loyalty, and business performance.

- ## Description
  In business modeling, "Profile (ID)" refers to the detailed description and analysis of specific elements within a business model, such as customers, competitors, or products. This concept is essential in a business model as it provides a comprehensive understanding of these elements, enabling companies to make informed decisions and devise effective strategies.
  
  Profile ID typically involves the following aspects:
  
  - Customer Profile: This involves a detailed description of a company's target customers, including their needs, preferences, behaviors, and characteristics. For example, a company might create a profile for a segment of customers who are young, tech-savvy, and value sustainability. This allows the company to tailor its products, services, or marketing messages to meet the specific needs and preferences of these customers.
  
  - Competitor Profile: This involves a thorough analysis of a company's competitors, including their strengths, weaknesses, strategies, and market positions. For instance, a company might create a profile for a competitor who is a market leader, known for its innovative products and aggressive marketing. This enables the company to understand its competitive landscape and devise effective competitive strategies.
  
  - Product Profile: This involves a comprehensive description of a company's products or services, including their features, benefits, pricing, and positioning. For example, a company might create a profile for a product that is high-quality, competitively priced, and positioned as a luxury item. This allows the company to understand its product's appeal and value proposition, and formulate effective product strategies.
  
  For instance, a company might create a profile for a segment of customers who are environmentally conscious and prefer eco-friendly products. The company might also create a profile for a competitor who is known for its sustainable practices and popular among these customers. Based on these profiles, the company might decide to develop and market a new line of eco-friendly products to meet the needs of these customers and compete effectively with this competitor. This would demonstrate the company's ability to leverage its understanding of Profile (ID) to drive its business model and create value.

  In business modeling, the concept of "profile (id)/segmentation" refers to the process of dividing a company's market into distinct groups of buyers who might require separate products or marketing mixes. These groups, or segments, are defined by shared characteristics such as demographics, behaviors, needs, or preferences. 
  
  The profile (id)/segmentation is a fundamental component of business design as it allows companies to target their products or services more effectively, understand their customers better, and allocate their resources more efficiently. It enables businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors, meet the specific needs of their customers, and achieve a competitive advantage.
  
  For instance, a clothing retailer may segment its market into different profiles such as teenagers, young adults, and seniors. Each segment has different fashion tastes, shopping behaviors, and purchasing power. Teenagers might prefer trendy and affordable clothes, young adults might look for professional and high-quality outfits, and seniors might value comfort and durability.
  
  By understanding the unique characteristics and needs of each segment, the retailer can tailor its products, pricing, and marketing strategies to meet the specific needs of each segment. It can create a personalized shopping experience, build stronger relationships with its customers, and increase customer loyalty and satisfaction.
  
  In essence, the profile (id)/segmentation is a strategic tool that enables businesses to understand and serve their market more effectively, create and deliver value more efficiently, and achieve sustainable growth. It is the foundation of customer-centric business design and a key driver of business success.

Companies need to identify and understand their customer segments in order to effectively meet their distinct needs and solve their problems.
  - [[Market Segmentation]]
    - This is a strategic tool used to divide a broad target market into subsets of consumers with similar needs and characteristics. The four main types of market segmentation are demographic, geographic, psychographic, and behavioral. This tool helps businesses to target these segments effectively and allocate marketing resources appropriately.
  - [[Persona Development]]
    - This tool involves creating fictional characters that represent your different customer segments. Each persona is based on research and includes specific details about the character’s demographics, behaviors, needs, motivations, and challenges. This helps businesses to understand and empathize with their customers on a deeper level.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, helps businesses to understand their customer segments better by focusing on customer jobs, pains, and gains.

  The concept of "Profile (ID)/Persona" in business modeling refers to the creation and understanding of fictional characters who represent the different user types that might use a company's products or services. These personas are based on user research and include details such as demographics, behavior patterns, motivations, and goals. They are used to help businesses understand and cater to the needs of their target audience.
  
  In the "Profile (ID)/Persona" model, businesses use various tools and techniques to gather and analyze information about their potential users. This could involve conducting surveys, interviews, and focus groups, as well as analyzing market research and user data. The goal is to create detailed and realistic personas that accurately represent the different types of users that a business is targeting.
  
  For example, a fitness app might create personas for different types of users, such as a busy professional who wants quick workouts, a fitness enthusiast who wants advanced routines, and a beginner who needs guidance and motivation. These personas would include details about their fitness goals, their lifestyle, their preferences for workout types and times, and their challenges and pain points. This information could then be used to design a product that meets the needs of these different users, and to create marketing messages that resonate with them.
  
  Alternatively, a B2B software company might create personas for different roles within a company, such as a CEO who is concerned with overall business performance, a manager who needs to track team productivity, and an individual contributor who needs to manage their tasks and time. These personas would include details about their job responsibilities, their challenges and pain points, and their goals and motivations. This information could then be used to design a product that solves their specific problems and meets their needs, and to create marketing messages that speak to their unique concerns and goals.
  
  The "Profile (ID)/Persona" concept in business modeling is crucial because it helps businesses to understand and empathize with their users, and to design products and services that meet their needs. This can lead to increased user satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, business success.

  The concept of "profile (id)/goals" in business modeling refers to the identification and characterization of individual or group profiles within a company's market, and aligning them with specific goals. These profiles are created based on a variety of factors, such as demographic details, buying behaviors, needs, preferences, lifestyle characteristics, and more. The associated goals are then set in accordance with these profiles to ensure that the company's offerings meet the specific needs and preferences of each group.
  
  The goals associated with each profile can be diverse, ranging from increasing customer satisfaction, boosting sales, improving product quality, to enhancing brand awareness. The aim is to create a comprehensive understanding of each profile, which can then be used to tailor products, services, and marketing efforts to achieve the set goals.
  
  For instance, a clothing retailer might identify a profile of customers who are fashion-forward and prefer high-end brands. The goals for this profile might include increasing brand loyalty, boosting sales of premium products, and enhancing the company's reputation as a luxury retailer. The retailer would then develop products and marketing strategies specifically targeted at this group to achieve these goals.
  
  In essence, the concept of "profile (id)/goals" in business modeling is about creating detailed portraits of each customer group or individual, based on shared characteristics and behaviors, and aligning them with specific business goals. This allows a company to better understand its customers and tailor its offerings and marketing efforts accordingly, leading to improved customer satisfaction and business performance. It is a key component of business design, informing the development of a company's products, services, and marketing strategies.

  In business modeling, the concept of "profile (id)/perceptions" refers to the understanding and interpretation of a specific group of customers, users, or stakeholders based on their individual profiles. This concept goes beyond the mere collection of demographic or psychographic characteristics, and delves into how these individuals perceive a product, service, or the company itself.
  
  The "profile (id)/perceptions" concept involves gathering and analyzing data on how the target audience perceives the value, quality, and relevance of a product or service. It also includes their perceptions of the company's brand, reputation, and customer service. This information is often collected through surveys, interviews, focus groups, social media monitoring, and other forms of market research.
  
  For example, a company that sells eco-friendly products might have a profile (id)/perceptions model that includes perceptions about the importance of sustainability, the perceived value and quality of eco-friendly products, attitudes towards the company's environmental initiatives, and beliefs about the company's commitment to sustainability.
  
  The concept of "profile (id)/perceptions" is crucial in business modeling as it provides insights into the target audience's mindset, which can guide the development of products, services, and marketing strategies. By understanding their customers' perceptions, companies can address any misconceptions, align their offerings with customer expectations, and build a strong, positive brand image. This can enhance customer satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, business performance.

  The concept of "Emotions" in business modeling refers to the emotional aspects that influence the behaviors and decisions of customers, employees, and other stakeholders. This concept is crucial in a business model as it helps companies understand and manage these emotional aspects to enhance their relationships with these stakeholders, improve their experiences, and ultimately, drive their business success.
  
  Emotions in business modeling typically involve the following aspects:
  
  - Customer Emotions: This involves understanding and managing the emotions that influence customers' behaviors and decisions, such as their purchases, loyalty, and advocacy. For example, a company might identify that its customers feel frustrated with its complicated purchasing process. The company might then simplify this process to alleviate this frustration, enhance their purchasing experience, and increase their satisfaction and loyalty.
  
  - Employee Emotions: This involves recognizing and addressing the emotions that affect employees' performance, engagement, and retention. For instance, a company might discover that its employees feel stressed due to heavy workloads. The company might then reduce these workloads or provide stress management support to alleviate this stress, boost their morale and productivity, and retain their talent.
  
  - Stakeholder Emotions: This involves acknowledging and responding to the emotions that impact stakeholders' perceptions, support, and interactions. For example, a company might realize that its shareholders feel anxious about its financial stability. The company might then communicate its financial performance and plans more transparently to alleviate this anxiety, build their trust, and secure their support.
  
  For instance, a company might identify that its customers feel delighted when they receive personalized services. The company might then implement a customer relationship management system to provide more personalized services, enhance their customer experience, and increase their satisfaction and loyalty. This would demonstrate the company's ability to leverage its understanding of "Emotions" to drive its business model and create value.

It is the foundation of a company's relationship with its customers and the key to its market success.
  
  For instance, a software company may offer a unique value proposition to its business customers by providing innovative, reliable, and user-friendly software solutions that help businesses improve their productivity, reduce their costs, and grow their revenues. The company may also offer superior customer service, technical support, and training to ensure that its customers can fully utilize its software and achieve their business goals.
  
  The software company's value proposition is not just about its software. It is about the total value that the company delivers to its customers, including the quality of its software, the benefits that its software brings to its customers, and the support that the company provides to its customers. It is about how the company solves its customers' problems, meets their needs, and creates value for them.
  
  In essence, the profile (id)/value proposition is a strategic tool that enables businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors, attract and retain their customers, and achieve their business goals. It is the heart of business design and a key driver of business success.

  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, the "Value Proposition" is one of the nine key components. It refers to the unique combination of products and services that a company offers to its customers. The value proposition should be designed in a way that it solves a problem or fulfills a need of the customer, making it the main reason for a customer to choose one company over another.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is specifically designed to help businesses understand their customers' needs and design a value proposition that meets those needs. It consists of two parts: the customer profile and the value map. The customer profile describes the jobs, pains, and gains of a specific customer segment, while the value map describes how the company's products and services create value for this customer segment.
  - [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
    - The Blue Ocean Strategy is a business theory that suggests companies are better off searching for ways to play in uncontested market spaces (Blue Oceans) rather than competing with similar businesses in an existing industry (Red Oceans). One of the key tools in this strategy is the "Value Curve", which is a graphical depiction of a company's relative performance across its industry's factors of competition. This tool can help a company to design a unique value proposition that differentiates it from its competitors.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The SWOT analysis can also be used to evaluate a company's value proposition. Strengths and weaknesses can highlight aspects of the value proposition that are working well or need improvement, while opportunities and threats can identify external factors that could affect the value proposition in the future.
  - [[Jobs to be Done]]
    - This theory, developed by Clayton Christensen, suggests that customers hire products and services to do specific jobs. By understanding what job a customer needs to get done, a company can design a value proposition that perfectly fits this job. This approach can lead to highly differentiated and customer-centric value propositions.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Profile (ID)/Quantified Value Proposition" in business modeling is an argumentation based on metrics of the amount of value that the user receives when using a company's solution. It is a strategic tool used to communicate the unique value that a product or service provides to its target audience, quantified in terms of specific benefits.
  
  In this model, businesses use various tools and techniques to gather and analyze data about the value their solution provides. This could involve conducting user research, analyzing market research and user data, and measuring the impact of their solution on key performance indicators (KPIs). The goal is to quantify the value proposition in a way that is meaningful and compelling to the target audience.
  
  For example, a cloud storage company might quantify its value proposition by stating that its solution increases productivity by 30%, reduces costs by 50%, and improves data security by 90%. These figures are based on metrics that the company has measured, such as the time saved by using their solution, the cost savings achieved, and the reduction in data breaches.
  
  Alternatively, a fitness app might quantify its value proposition by stating that users who use their app for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, see an average weight loss of 10 pounds in 3 months. These figures are based on user data and research, and provide a clear and compelling argument for the value of the app.
  
  The "Profile (ID)/Quantified Value Proposition" concept in business modeling is crucial because it helps businesses to communicate the unique value of their solution in a way that is meaningful and compelling to their target audience. This can lead to increased user adoption, satisfaction, and loyalty, and ultimately, business success.

  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, the "Value Proposition" is a key component that describes the unique value a company offers to its customers. This value is often quantified in terms of benefits minus cost. It's crucial to understand the customer profile (id) to tailor the value proposition to meet their specific needs and expectations.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is an extension of the Business Model Canvas. It focuses specifically on the value proposition and customer segment components. The tool helps businesses to design compelling value propositions by understanding the customer's needs and delivering quantified value.
  - [[Lean Startup Methodology]]
    - The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, emphasizes the importance of getting customer feedback during the early stages of a business. This feedback is used to refine the value proposition, ensuring it delivers quantified value that meets the customer's needs.
  - [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
    - This strategy, developed by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, encourages businesses to create new market space (or "blue oceans") where competition is irrelevant. The strategy involves delivering a leap in value for both the company and its customers. The quantified value proposition is a key component of this strategy.
  - [[Jobs-to-be-Done Framework]]
    - This framework, developed by Clayton Christensen, focuses on understanding the customer's "job" – the progress they are trying to make in a particular circumstance. The framework helps businesses to design value propositions that help customers get their "job" done more effectively or efficiently, providing a clear quantification of value.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - While SWOT analysis is a more general tool, it can be used to evaluate the strength of a company's value proposition. A strong, quantified value proposition can be a significant strength, while a weak or unclear value proposition can be a major weakness. Opportunities and threats in the market can also impact the value proposition.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - This tool can help businesses understand how external factors may impact their value proposition. For example, technological advancements may enable a company to deliver more value to its customers, while legal changes may restrict how a company can deliver value.

- ## Description
  The concept of "profile (id)/relationship" in business modeling refers to the identification and characterization of the relationships a company maintains with its stakeholders, which can be personal, automated, self-service, among others. These relationships are established and managed based on the specific profile or identity of each stakeholder.
  
  The profile of a stakeholder can be defined by various factors such as their role, interests, influence, and interaction with the company. The relationship, on the other hand, refers to the nature and extent of the company's engagement with the stakeholder. This can range from personal interactions, such as face-to-face meetings or phone calls, to automated interactions, such as email newsletters or mobile app notifications. Self-service interactions, such as using a website or app to make purchases or access services, are also part of this concept.
  
  For example, a company might identify a profile of customers who prefer online shopping. The relationship with this profile could be largely automated, with the company using email marketing, personalized product recommendations, and a user-friendly e-commerce platform to engage with these customers. The goal would be to enhance the online shopping experience, increase customer satisfaction, and ultimately, boost online sales.
  
  In essence, the concept of "profile (id)/relationship" in business modeling is about understanding who a company's stakeholders are, how they prefer to interact with the company, and managing these relationships effectively to meet both the stakeholders' needs and the company's objectives. This is a crucial aspect of business design, as it informs the development of a company's customer engagement strategies, communication channels, and service delivery methods.

  In business modeling, the concept of "profile (id)/messages" refers to the strategic communication that a company wants to convey to a specific group of customers, users, or stakeholders based on their individual profiles. This concept is about crafting and delivering messages that resonate with the target audience and prompt them to take a specific action.
  
  The "profile (id)/messages" concept involves understanding the target audience's needs, preferences, and motivations, and then creating messages that address these factors. These messages could be about a product's features, benefits, or value proposition, or about the company's mission, vision, or values. The goal is to communicate in a way that is meaningful and compelling to the target audience, and that encourages them to engage with the company, purchase a product, subscribe to a service, or support a cause.
  
  For instance, a fitness center might have a profile (id)/messages model that includes messages about the health benefits of regular exercise, the variety of classes and equipment available, the qualifications of their trainers, and the supportive and fun community at the center. These messages are designed to appeal to people who value health and fitness, enjoy variety in their workouts, prefer professional guidance, and appreciate a community atmosphere.
  
  The concept of "profile (id)/messages" is vital in business modeling as it helps to shape the company's communication strategy. By tailoring their messages to the target audience's profile, companies can increase the effectiveness of their communication, enhance their relationship with customers, and drive desired actions. This can lead to increased customer engagement, improved brand perception, and higher conversion rates.

- ## Description
  - In a business model, "channels" refer to the various methods and pathways a company uses to communicate with its customers and deliver its products or services. These channels play a crucial role in customer experience, as they are the touchpoints that directly interact with the market. They can be broadly categorized into two types:
  - Distribution Channels: These are the pathways through which a product or service physically reaches the customer. This can include retail stores, online marketplaces, direct sales, third-party distributors, or any other means of getting the product into the customer's hands.
  - Marketing and Communication Channels: These channels are used for conveying messages, advertising, and building brand awareness. They encompass a wide range of tools such as social media, email marketing, TV and radio advertising, public relations, and content marketing.
  - The choice of channels depends on the target audience, the nature of the product or service, competitive landscape, and the overall strategy of the company. Effective channel management ensures that the product or service is available to the customer in the most convenient and efficient way possible, while also supporting the branding and marketing objectives of the business.
  - In the context of a business model, channels are not only conduits for sales but also for customer feedback and relationship building. They contribute to the overall customer journey and experience, playing a vital role in customer satisfaction and loyalty. Therefore, a well-thought-out channel strategy is essential for the success of any business model.

  The concept of "Profile (ID)/Assets" in business modeling refers to the tangible and intangible resources that a company's clients possess and that can be leveraged for the benefit of the business. These assets can range from physical properties to skills, knowledge, relationships, and other forms of capital that the clients have. Understanding and utilizing these assets can provide significant advantages to a company's business model.
  
  Here are the key aspects of "Profile (ID)/Assets" in business modeling:
  
  - Client's Physical Assets: These are the tangible resources that clients own, such as properties, equipment, and products. A company can leverage these assets to enhance its operations, offerings, and value proposition. For example, a real estate company might utilize its clients' properties to expand its portfolio and increase its market presence.
  
  - Client's Intellectual Assets: These are the knowledge, skills, and expertise that clients have. A company can leverage these assets to improve its products, services, and processes. For example, a consulting firm might utilize its clients' industry knowledge to refine its consulting services and provide more relevant and valuable advice.
  
  - Client's Relational Assets: These are the relationships and networks that clients have. A company can leverage these assets to broaden its reach, partnerships, and opportunities. For example, a marketing agency might utilize its clients' networks to gain access to potential customers and partners.
  
  - Client's Financial Assets: These are the financial resources that clients have. A company can leverage these assets to fund its growth, innovation, and sustainability. For example, a startup might utilize its clients' investments to finance its research and development and scale its business.
  
  By understanding and leveraging these "Profile (ID)/Assets", a company can enhance its business model, create more value, and achieve greater success. For instance, a software company might identify that its clients have significant technical skills. The company might then develop more advanced software that these skilled clients can use, thereby enhancing its product offering, customer satisfaction, and competitive advantage. This would demonstrate the company's ability to leverage its understanding of "Profile (ID)/Assets" to drive its business model and create value.

- ## Description
  The concept of "profile (id)/transactions" in business modeling refers to the collection of data and activities associated with a specific customer or business transaction. This concept is crucial in understanding and managing the interactions between a business and its customers or partners.
  
  In this model, a profile (id) represents a unique identifier for a customer or a transaction. This could be a customer's account number, a transaction ID, or any other unique identifier. This profile (id) is used to track, manage, and analyze all the transactions associated with that particular customer or transaction.
  
  The transactions, on the other hand, represent the various activities or interactions that occur between the business and the customer or between the business and other businesses. These could include sales transactions, customer service interactions, payment transactions, supply chain transactions, and so on.
  
  For example, in a retail business, the profile (id) could be the customer's account number, and the transactions could include the customer's purchases, returns, customer service inquiries, and payment transactions. The business can use this data to understand the customer's buying behavior, preferences, and needs, and to manage its relationship with the customer.
  
  In a supply chain business, the profile (id) could be a transaction ID, and the transactions could include the ordering, delivery, and payment activities between the business and its suppliers or customers. The business can use this data to manage its supply chain operations, improve its efficiency, and reduce its costs.
  
  In essence, the profile (id)/transactions model is a powerful tool for businesses to manage their operations, understand their customers, and drive their performance. It is a key component of business design and a critical driver of business success.

  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, "customer relationships" and "customer segments" are two of the nine key components. These components can be used to define and understand the profile (ID) of the customers and the transactions they perform. The "customer relationships" component describes the type of relationship a company has with its specific customer segments, while the "customer segments" component defines the different groups of people or organizations an enterprise aims to reach and serve.
  - [[Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems]]
    - CRM systems are tools that businesses use to manage interactions with current and potential customers. They use data analysis about customers' history with a company to improve business relationships with customers, specifically focusing on customer retention and ultimately driving sales growth. This tool is directly related to the profile (ID)/transactions component as it collects, analyzes, and uses the data associated with specific customers and their transactions.
  - [[Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)]]
    - DFDs are graphical tools used in systems analysis that show the flow of data through a system and the work or processing performed by that system. In the context of profile (ID)/transactions, DFDs can be used to model the flow of transaction data from its source (the customer profile) to its final destination (the transaction processing system).
  - [[Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)]]
    - ERDs are used in data modeling to describe the data or information aspects of a business domain or its process requirements.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Profile (ID)/Journey" in business modeling refers to the sequential stages that a stakeholder experiences in their interaction with a business. This journey can be visualized as a roadmap or timeline, detailing each touchpoint between the stakeholder and the business, from initial awareness or discovery, through engagement and transaction, to post-purchase support and advocacy.
  
  In this model, businesses map out the journey of their stakeholders (which could be customers, employees, partners, or investors) to understand their needs, motivations, and pain points at each stage. This journey mapping process involves research, observation, and data analysis, and aims to provide a holistic view of the stakeholder's experience.
  
  For example, a customer's journey with an e-commerce business might start with discovering the business through a social media ad, then visiting the website, browsing products, making a purchase, receiving the product, and finally writing a review or recommending the business to a friend. At each stage, the business can identify opportunities to enhance the customer's experience, such as by improving website navigation, offering personalized product recommendations, or providing exceptional customer service.
  
  The "Profile (ID)/Journey" concept in business modeling is essential because it helps businesses to understand and improve the experiences of their stakeholders. By mapping out these journeys, businesses can identify opportunities to enhance stakeholder satisfaction and loyalty, improve processes, and ultimately drive business growth and success.

- ## Description
  The concept of "profile (id)/funnel" in business modeling refers to the process that a customer goes through in their journey with a company, from the initial point of contact to the final action or conversion. This process is often visualized as a funnel due to the decreasing number of customers at each step.
  
  Each step in the funnel represents a specific action that the customer takes in relation to the company. For example, the first step might be visiting the company's website, the second step could be clicking on a product for more information, the third step might be adding the product to the shopping cart, and the final step would be purchasing the product.
  
  The "profile (id)" part of the concept refers to the identification of the customer at each step. This could be based on various factors such as their browsing behavior, purchase history, demographic information, and more. The profile helps the company to understand who their customers are and what they are interested in, which can inform their marketing and sales strategies.
  
  The "funnel" part of the concept refers to the percentage of customers who move from one step to the next. This is a key metric for understanding the effectiveness of the company's customer journey and identifying areas for improvement. For example, if a large percentage of customers drop off at the shopping cart stage, this could indicate a problem with the checkout process that needs to be addressed.
  
  In essence, the concept of "profile (id)/funnel" in business modeling is about understanding and optimizing the customer journey. It provides valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences, and helps the company to make data-driven decisions to improve customer engagement and conversion rates. This is a crucial aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the company's bottom line.

- ## Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "profile (id)/sales strategy" refers to the identification and targeting of specific customer groups with tailored sales approaches within a business model. This concept is about understanding the unique characteristics, needs, and preferences of different customer segments, and then designing and implementing sales strategies that are specifically tailored to these segments.
  
  The "profile (id)/sales strategy" concept involves conducting market research to identify the target customer groups, understanding their buying behaviors and motivations, and then developing sales strategies that address these factors. These strategies could include different sales techniques, channels, pricing models, or promotional offers, depending on the profile of the target customer group.
  
  For example, a software company might have a profile (id)/sales strategy model that includes a direct sales approach for large enterprises, a channel sales approach for small and medium-sized businesses, and an online self-service sales approach for individual users. These sales strategies are designed to cater to the different needs, preferences, and buying behaviors of these customer groups.
  
  The concept of "profile (id)/sales strategy" is crucial in business modeling as it helps to shape the company's sales strategy. By tailoring their sales approaches to the profile of the target customer groups, companies can increase the effectiveness of their sales efforts, enhance their relationship with customers, and drive revenue growth. This can lead to increased customer acquisition, improved customer retention, and higher sales performance.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Solution List" in business modeling refers to the array of products, services, or processes that a business offers to address the needs or problems of its customers. This concept is crucial as it directly relates to the value proposition of a business, which is the unique mix of products and services that a business offers to meet its customers' needs and differentiate itself from its competitors.
  
  Here are the key aspects of "Solution List" in business modeling:
  
  - Products: These are the tangible goods that a business offers to its customers. The products should be designed and developed to meet the specific needs or solve the particular problems of the customers. For example, a technology company might offer a range of software products to help businesses improve their productivity and efficiency.
  
  - Services: These are the intangible offerings that a business provides to its customers. The services should be tailored to address the unique challenges or requirements of the customers. For example, a consulting firm might offer a variety of advisory services to help businesses navigate complex market dynamics and make informed decisions.
  
  - Processes: These are the methods or procedures that a business uses to deliver its products or services to its customers. The processes should be optimized to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of the products or services. For example, a logistics company might have a streamlined distribution process to ensure the timely and safe delivery of goods to its customers.
  
  By carefully crafting its "Solution List", a business can ensure that it is effectively addressing the needs or problems of its customers, thereby enhancing its value proposition, customer satisfaction, and competitive advantage. For instance, a healthcare company might identify that its customers need more accessible and affordable healthcare services. The company might then develop a telehealth service that allows customers to consult with healthcare professionals remotely, thereby addressing the customers' needs and differentiating the company from its competitors. This would demonstrate the company's ability to leverage its "Solution List" to drive its business model and create value.

  The concept of "solution (id)" in business modeling refers to a specific product, service, or process that a business offers to address the needs or problems of its customers. This concept is central to the value proposition of a business and is a key driver of its competitive advantage.
  
  In this model, a solution (id) represents a unique identifier for a product, service, or process. This could be a product SKU, a service ID, or a process ID. This solution (id) is used to track, manage, and analyze all the activities associated with that particular product, service, or process.
  
  The solution (id) is designed to solve a specific problem or meet a specific need of the customers. It could be a tangible product, such as a smartphone or a car, an intangible service, such as a software subscription or a consulting service, or a process, such as a supply chain process or a customer service process.
  
  For example, in a technology company, the solution (id) could be a software product that helps businesses manage their customer relationships. The company can use this solution (id) to track the sales, usage, and performance of the software, to understand the needs and preferences of its customers, and to continuously improve the software to better meet the needs of its customers.
  
  In a consulting firm, the solution (id) could be a consulting service that helps businesses improve their operations. The firm can use this solution (id) to track the delivery, outcomes, and satisfaction of the service, to understand the problems and needs of its clients, and to continuously improve the service to better solve the problems of its clients.
  
  In essence, the solution (id) model is a powerful tool for businesses to create value for their customers, differentiate themselves from their competitors, and drive their growth. It is a key component of business design and a critical driver of business success.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Solution (ID)/Category" in business modeling refers to the categorization or grouping of similar solutions or products that share certain characteristics, functions, or purposes. This categorization helps in organizing and grouping solutions based on their similarities, making it easier for consumers to locate and compare different solutions within the same category.
  
  In this model, businesses classify their solutions into distinct categories, which can be based on various factors such as the solution's function, target market, price range, or any other distinguishing features. This categorization process involves market research, data analysis, and a deep understanding of the solution's features and benefits, as well as the needs and preferences of the target market.
  
  For instance, in the electronics industry, smartphones, laptops, and tablets are all examples of product categories. Each of these categories contains products that serve similar purposes and share certain characteristics. A consumer looking for a portable computing device, for example, can easily compare different products within the laptop category, making their purchase decision easier and more informed.
  
  The "Solution (ID)/Category" concept in business modeling is crucial because it helps businesses to organize their solutions in a way that is easy for consumers to understand and navigate. By categorizing their solutions, businesses can improve the customer's buying journey, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive sales and business growth.

  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, the "Value Proposition" component is closely related to the solution category. It describes the bundle of products and services that create value for a specific Customer Segment. It is the reason why customers turn to one company over another. It solves a customer problem or satisfies a customer need. Each value proposition consists of a selected bundle of products and/or services that caters to the requirements of a specific Customer Segment. In this respect, the suite of products or services provided by a business would fall into a specific solution category.
    
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is a detailed look at the "Value Proposition" and "Customer Segment" components of the Business Model Canvas. The "Products & Services" section of the canvas refers to the solution category, as it lists the products and services that will help the customer either solve a problem or satisfy a need.
  
  - [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
    - The Blue Ocean Strategy, developed by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, encourages businesses to create new market space (or "blue oceans") where competition is irrelevant. The "Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create Grid" helps businesses to decide which factors of competition to eliminate or reduce, and which factors to raise or create. These decisions will influence the solution category of the business.
  
  - [[Jobs to be Done Framework]]
    - This framework, developed by Clayton Christensen, helps businesses to understand the goal that customers are trying to achieve (the "job to be done"). The solution category of a business will be designed to help customers achieve these goals.
  
  - [[Porter's Five Forces]]
    - This tool, developed by Michael Porter, helps businesses to understand the competitive forces in their industry. The "Threat of Substitute Products or Services" force is particularly relevant to the solution category, as it refers to the possibility of customers finding a different way of solving their problem or meeting their need.

  The "solution (id)" part of the concept refers to the unique identifier of the final product or service. This could be a specific model of a product, a version of a software, or a type of service. The solution is what the customer interacts with and what ultimately delivers the value that the customer is seeking.
  
  The "components" part of the concept refers to the different technologies and parts that make up the solution. For example, in the case of a software product, the components could include the programming language used, the cloud platform on which it's hosted, the database system used, and so on. In the case of a physical product, the components could be the different parts that make up the product.
  
  Each component plays a crucial role in the functionality and performance of the solution. Therefore, it's important to carefully select and manage these components to ensure that they work together effectively to deliver a high-quality solution.
  
  In essence, the concept of "solution (id)/components" in business modeling is about understanding and managing the building blocks of a product or service. It provides a framework for designing and optimizing the solution, and helps the company to make informed decisions about the technologies and components to use. This is a key aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the quality of the product or service and the value it delivers to customers.

  The concept of "Solution (ID)/Roadmap" in business modeling is a strategic plan that outlines the steps and strategies needed to implement a business model solution. This roadmap serves as a guide for businesses to navigate their way from their current state to their desired future state. It is a critical tool for managing change, driving alignment, and facilitating decision-making within a business.
  
  Here are the key aspects of "Solution (ID)/Roadmap" in business modeling:
  
  - Vision: This is the desired future state of the business. The vision should be clear, compelling, and aligned with the business's strategic objectives. For example, a retail business might envision becoming the leading provider of sustainable fashion in its market.
  
  - Steps: These are the specific actions that the business needs to take to move from its current state to its desired future state. The steps should be practical, measurable, and aligned with the business's resources and capabilities. For example, the retail business might need to source sustainable materials, design eco-friendly products, and develop green manufacturing processes.
  
  - Strategies: These are the approaches that the business will use to execute the steps. The strategies should be effective, flexible, and aligned with the business's competitive environment. For example, the retail business might use a combination of partnerships, acquisitions, and organic growth to achieve its vision.
  
  - Milestones: These are the key achievements that the business aims to reach along its journey. The milestones should be significant, achievable, and aligned with the business's timeline. For example, the retail business might aim to launch its first sustainable product line within one year.
  
  By developing a "Solution (ID)/Roadmap", a business can ensure that it is moving in the right direction, making progress towards its vision, and creating value for its stakeholders. For instance, the retail business might use its roadmap to guide its transition to sustainable fashion, track its progress, and communicate its achievements to its customers, employees, and investors. This would demonstrate the business's ability to leverage its "Solution (ID)/Roadmap" to drive its business model and create value.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Solution (ID)/Pricing" in business modeling refers to the strategic approach to setting a price for a product or service. This strategy can be based on a variety of factors, including competitor prices, perceived customer value, production costs, and more. The goal of this model is to determine the optimal price point that maximizes profit while also providing value to the customer.
  
  In this model, businesses use different channels to implement their pricing strategy. These channels could include physical stores, online platforms, direct sales, or any other method of distribution. The chosen channels can significantly impact the pricing strategy, as they can influence factors such as market reach, customer perception, and operational costs.
  
  For example, a business might use market research to determine that their target customers perceive their product as high-quality and are willing to pay a premium price for it. They might also analyze their production costs and competitor prices to ensure their price point is profitable and competitive. They could then use online platforms to sell their product, taking advantage of the wide market reach and lower operational costs of e-commerce.
  
  The "Solution (ID)/Pricing" concept in business modeling is essential because it helps businesses to set prices that attract customers and drive sales while also ensuring profitability. By carefully considering factors such as customer value, production costs, and competitor prices, businesses can develop a pricing strategy that supports their overall business goals.

  - Marketing is the process of identifying and satisfying customer needs through the creation, promotion, and distribution of products or services.
- ## Content type ()
  - Content is of type text.
  
- ## Description
  In business design, the concept of "marketing" is understood as the strategic process of identifying, anticipating, and satisfying customer needs and wants, with the ultimate goal of driving profit. This process involves the creation, promotion, and distribution of products or services, and it is a critical component of any successful business model.
  
  Marketing begins with market research to understand the needs, preferences, and behaviors of the target customer segments. This research can involve various methods, such as surveys, interviews, focus groups, or analysis of market trends and consumer data. The insights gained from this research are then used to inform the design and development of products or services that meet the identified customer needs.
  
  Once the product or service is created, the next step in the marketing process is promotion. This involves communicating the value of the product or service to the target customers through various channels, such as advertising, public relations, social media, or direct marketing. The goal of promotion is to raise awareness, generate interest, and stimulate demand for the product or service.
  
  The final step in the marketing process is distribution, which involves getting the product or service into the hands of the customers. This can involve various strategies, such as selling directly to customers through online or physical stores, or using intermediaries like wholesalers or retailers.
  
  An example of marketing in business design could be a company that manufactures eco-friendly cleaning products. The company identifies a growing demand for sustainable products among environmentally-conscious consumers. It designs and develops a range of cleaning products using natural ingredients, and promotes these products through social media and influencer marketing targeting eco-conscious consumers. The company distributes its products through online stores and selected retailers that cater to eco-conscious consumers.
  
  In conclusion, marketing is a vital process in business design that helps companies to identify and satisfy customer needs, create value, and drive business growth. It involves a strategic combination of market research, product or service design, promotion, and distribution, all aimed at meeting the needs and wants of the target customers.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Naming" in business modeling refers to the process of selecting and defining the name of a business, product, or service within a business model. This is a crucial aspect of business design as it plays a significant role in shaping the identity and perception of the business or its offerings in the market. 
  
  Here are the key aspects of "Naming" in business modeling:
  
  - Relevance: The name should be relevant to the business, product, or service it represents. It should give an indication of what the business or product is about. For example, a company that specializes in organic food products might choose a name that reflects its commitment to natural, healthy ingredients.
  
  - Distinctiveness: The name should be unique and stand out in the market. This helps to differentiate the business or product from its competitors. For example, a tech startup might choose a name that is innovative and futuristic to set itself apart in the tech industry.
  
  - Memorability: The name should be easy to remember. This helps to ensure that the business or product stays top of mind for consumers. For example, a fashion brand might choose a name that is catchy and easy to pronounce to make it memorable for its target audience.
  
  - Legality: The name should be legally available for use. This means checking that the name is not already trademarked or in use by another business. For example, a new restaurant might need to do a trademark search to ensure its chosen name is legally available.
  
  - Marketability: The name should be marketable. This means it should be appealing to the target audience and suitable for use in advertising and promotional materials. For example, a children's toy company might choose a name that is fun and appealing to kids.
  
  By carefully considering these aspects in the "Naming" process, a business can create a strong and effective name that supports its business model and contributes to its success in the market. For instance, the organic food company might use its name to communicate its commitment to natural ingredients, differentiate itself from competitors, and create a memorable brand for consumers. This would demonstrate the company's ability to leverage "Naming" to drive its business model and create value.

- ## Description
  Branding, in the context of business modeling, is a strategic process that involves creating a unique identity, image, and position for a business, product, or service in the minds of its target audience. This is achieved through a combination of elements such as name, logo, design, messaging, and customer experience, which together form the brand identity.
  
  The purpose of branding is to differentiate a business or its offerings from its competitors, build a strong and positive perception in the market, and foster customer loyalty. It is a way for a business to communicate its values, personality, and promise to its customers, and to create emotional connections with them.
  
  For example, consider the brand Apple. Its branding strategy revolves around the concepts of innovation, simplicity, and premium quality. The Apple logo, the minimalist design of its products, the unique user experience they provide, and the consistent messaging across all its communications, all contribute to a strong and distinctive brand identity. This branding has helped Apple to stand out in the highly competitive technology market, command a premium price for its products, and build a loyal customer base.
  
  In essence, branding is not just about having a catchy name or a stylish logo. It is about creating a holistic and consistent experience that resonates with the customers and influences their perceptions and behaviors. It is a critical aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the customer's decision to choose one product or service over another, and their overall relationship with the business.

  The concept of "Visual Identity" in business modeling refers to the visual elements that make up a company's brand image. This includes the logo, color scheme, typography, and other visual elements that are consistently used across all platforms and mediums to represent the company. The visual identity is a crucial part of a company's brand, as it helps to create a recognizable and memorable image in the minds of consumers.
  
  In this model, businesses carefully design and select each visual element to reflect their brand's values, personality, and message. For example, a company that wants to convey a sense of luxury and exclusivity might choose a sleek, minimalist logo and a sophisticated color scheme. On the other hand, a company that wants to appear friendly and approachable might opt for a colorful, playful logo and typography.
  
  The visual identity is not just about aesthetics; it also plays a strategic role in the company's marketing and communication efforts. A strong visual identity can help a company stand out from its competitors, attract its target audience, and build brand loyalty. It can also influence consumers' perceptions and attitudes towards the company and its products or services.
  
  For instance, a tech company might use a modern and innovative visual identity to position itself as a leader in the industry and attract a young, tech-savvy audience. Meanwhile, a food company might use a warm and inviting visual identity to evoke feelings of comfort and nostalgia and appeal to families.

- ## Description
  A Metric List, in the context of business design, is a set of quantifiable measures that are used to assess the performance and effectiveness of a business model. These metrics serve as a tool for businesses to track their progress towards achieving their strategic objectives, and to identify areas where improvements can be made.
  
  The Metric List begins with the identification of key performance indicators (KPIs). These are the critical measures that reflect the success or failure of a business model. KPIs can be financial, such as revenue or profit margins, or non-financial, such as customer satisfaction or employee turnover rates.
  
  Once the KPIs have been identified, the next step is to establish benchmarks or targets for each metric. These benchmarks serve as a standard against which the actual performance of the business can be compared. They can be based on industry standards, historical performance, or strategic objectives.
  
  The Metric List also includes a system for tracking and reporting on these metrics. This could involve the use of dashboards, reports, or other data visualization tools that allow businesses to monitor their performance in real-time. This system should be designed to provide clear, concise, and actionable information to decision-makers.
  
  Finally, the Metric List includes a process for reviewing and updating the metrics. This is because the relevance and usefulness of metrics can change over time due to factors such as changes in the business environment, strategic shifts, or advancements in technology.
  
  An example of a Metric List in business design could be a retail company that uses metrics such as sales revenue, customer footfall, average transaction value, and customer satisfaction scores to evaluate the performance of its business model. The company would set targets for each of these metrics, track their performance using a dashboard, and regularly review and update the metrics to ensure they remain relevant and useful.
  
  In conclusion, a Metric List is a vital tool in business design that enables businesses to measure the performance and effectiveness of their business model. It provides a structured approach to tracking progress, identifying areas for improvement, and driving business growth and success.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Lifetime Value" in business modeling refers to the total net present value of the revenue that a customer is expected to generate over the course of their relationship with a business. This is a crucial component of business design as it helps businesses understand the long-term financial value of their customers and informs strategic decisions about sales, marketing, product development, and customer support.
  
  Here are the key aspects of "Lifetime Value" in business modeling:
  
  - Customer Acquisition: This involves the cost and strategies used to attract new customers. The lower the cost of acquiring a new customer, the higher their potential lifetime value.
  
  - Purchase Frequency: This refers to how often a customer makes a purchase. The more frequently a customer purchases, the higher their lifetime value.
  
  - Average Purchase Value: This is the average amount a customer spends per purchase. The higher the average purchase value, the higher the customer's lifetime value.
  
  - Customer Retention: This involves the strategies used to keep customers and reduce churn. The longer a business can retain a customer, the higher their lifetime value.
  
  - Profit Margin: This is the profit made from each customer after subtracting the costs associated with serving them. The higher the profit margin, the higher the customer's lifetime value.
  
  By understanding and optimizing these aspects of "Lifetime Value", a business can maximize the profitability of its customer relationships. For instance, a subscription-based software company might invest in customer service and product enhancements to increase customer retention and, therefore, lifetime value. This would demonstrate the company's ability to leverage "Lifetime Value" to drive its business model and create value.

- ## Description
  The concept of Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), in the context of business modeling, refers to the total cost that a business incurs to attract and convert a potential customer into an actual customer. This includes all the expenses related to marketing and sales activities, such as advertising, promotions, sales personnel salaries, commissions, and any other costs associated with the customer acquisition process.
  
  The purpose of calculating the CAC is to understand how much a business is spending to acquire each new customer. This is a critical metric for any business, as it directly impacts its profitability and sustainability. If the CAC is too high, it means that the business is spending too much to acquire customers, which can erode its profits and even lead to losses. On the other hand, if the CAC is too low, it might indicate that the business is not investing enough in customer acquisition, which can limit its growth and market share.
  
  For example, consider an online retail business that spends $100,000 on a marketing campaign and acquires 1,000 new customers as a result. The CAC in this case would be $100 (i.e., $100,000 / 1,000 customers). This means that the business needs to generate at least $100 in profit from each new customer, just to cover the cost of acquiring them.
  
  In essence, the CAC is not just a cost figure for a business. It is a strategic metric that helps a business to assess the effectiveness of its marketing and sales efforts, optimize its customer acquisition strategies, and ensure its financial health. It is a crucial aspect of business design, as it directly influences the business's growth, profitability, and long-term success.

  The concept of "people" in business modeling refers to the founders or individuals who establish and initiate a business model. These individuals often take on leadership roles in the development and growth of the business. They are the visionaries who conceive the business idea, identify the market opportunity, and design the business model to exploit this opportunity.
  
  The role of the founders is critical in a business model because they are the ones who set the direction and strategy of the business. They make key decisions about the business's value proposition, target market, revenue streams, cost structure, and other elements of the business model. They also often play a significant role in securing the resources needed to launch and grow the business, such as capital, talent, and partnerships.
  
  For example, in a tech startup, the founders might be the ones who come up with an innovative software solution, identify the potential customers for this solution, and design a business model to deliver this solution to the market. They might also be the ones who raise venture capital, recruit a talented team, and forge strategic partnerships to support the startup's growth.
  
  In addition to their strategic role, the founders also often play a key operational role in the business, especially in the early stages. They might be involved in product development, sales, marketing, customer service, and other operational activities. This hands-on involvement allows them to understand the business's operations intimately, make informed decisions, and drive the business's growth and success.
  
  In essence, the concept of "people" in business modeling is about recognizing the pivotal role of the founders in establishing, developing, and growing the business. It's a crucial aspect of business design, as the founders' vision, decisions, and actions can significantly impact the business's trajectory and performance.

  The concept of "Person (ID)" in business modeling refers to a physical individual who assumes a specific role within the business and is considered a stakeholder. This concept is crucial in business design as it helps to identify and define the various roles that individuals play within a business model, and how they interact with other elements of the model.
  
  A "Person (ID)" can be anyone who has a direct or indirect impact on the business, such as employees, customers, suppliers, investors, or regulators. Each person is assigned a unique identifier (ID) to distinguish them from others and to track their interactions and contributions to the business.
  
  The role of a "Person (ID)" can vary widely depending on the nature of the business and the specific business model. For example, in a retail business, a "Person (ID)" could be a customer who purchases products, an employee who manages inventory, or a supplier who provides goods.
  
  Understanding and defining the "Person (ID)" is critical for several reasons. Firstly, it helps to clarify roles and responsibilities within the business, ensuring that all tasks are assigned and managed effectively. Secondly, it provides a basis for tracking and measuring performance, as each person's actions and results can be linked back to their unique ID. Finally, it enables more effective communication and collaboration, as each person can be identified and engaged with individually.
  
  In conclusion, the concept of "Person (ID)" is a fundamental component of business design and modeling. It provides a structured way to identify and manage the various individuals who play a role in the business, and to understand how they contribute to the overall performance and success of the business model.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Person (ID)/Skills" in business modeling refers to the unique identification and competencies of individuals within a business model. This concept is crucial in business design as it helps businesses understand the unique value each individual brings to the organization and informs strategic decisions about talent acquisition, development, and management.
  
  Here are the key aspects of "Person (ID)/Skills" in business modeling:
  
  - Unique Identification: This involves assigning a unique identifier to each individual in the organization. This allows for accurate tracking and management of individuals, which is essential for effective human resource management.
  
  - Skills and Competencies: This refers to the specific abilities and knowledge that an individual possesses. Understanding the skills and competencies of each individual helps the organization to effectively allocate resources, assign tasks, and develop talent.
  
  - Talent Acquisition: This involves the strategies used to attract and recruit individuals with the necessary skills and competencies. The more effectively a business can acquire talent, the more successful it will be.
  
  - Talent Development: This refers to the strategies used to enhance the skills and competencies of individuals within the organization. This not only improves the performance of the individual but also increases the overall capability of the organization.
  
  - Talent Management: This involves the strategies used to retain, motivate, and manage individuals within the organization. Effective talent management can increase employee satisfaction, reduce turnover, and improve organizational performance.
  
  By understanding and optimizing these aspects of "Person (ID)/Skills", a business can maximize the value of its human resources. For instance, a tech company might invest in training and development programs to enhance the skills of its employees, thereby increasing the overall capability of the organization. This would demonstrate the company's ability to leverage "Person (ID)/Skills" to drive its business model and create value.

  The concept of Person (ID)/Functions in business modeling refers to the identification and specification of the roles and responsibilities that a person, who is a stakeholder in the business, can perform. This is based on their capacity, skills, and experience to successfully carry out these functions. 
  
  In this model, each person is assigned a unique identifier (ID) to differentiate them from other stakeholders. The functions they can perform are then defined and associated with their ID. These functions can range from strategic decision-making and management tasks to operational activities and customer service roles. 
  
  The purpose of the Person (ID)/Functions model is to clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities within a business, ensuring that every function is covered by a competent person. This helps to avoid confusion, overlaps, and gaps in responsibilities, which can lead to inefficiencies and errors. It also enables the business to leverage the strengths and expertise of its stakeholders, by assigning them functions that they are best suited to perform.
  
  For example, in a software development company, a person with the ID 'Developer1' might be assigned functions such as 'Code Development', 'Code Review', and 'Bug Fixing'. Another person with the ID 'Manager1' might be assigned functions such as 'Project Management', 'Resource Allocation', and 'Performance Evaluation'. 
  
  In essence, the Person (ID)/Functions model is a critical aspect of business design. It helps to structure the business, optimize its operations, and ensure that every stakeholder is contributing effectively to its success. It also provides a foundation for other business modeling concepts, such as process mapping and workflow design, by defining who does what in the business.

  The concept of a "Position List" in business modeling refers to a strategic document that outlines the roles, responsibilities, and hierarchy of positions within a business. This is a critical component in business design as it provides a clear structure for the organization and helps to define the roles and responsibilities of each position. 
  
  Here are the key aspects of a "Position List" in business modeling:
  
  - Roles: This refers to the specific duties or tasks that a position is responsible for. Clearly defined roles ensure that all tasks within the organization are accounted for and that there is no overlap or confusion about who is responsible for what.
  
  - Responsibilities: This refers to the obligations or expectations associated with a position. Clearly defined responsibilities ensure that each position knows what is expected of them and what they are accountable for.
  
  - Hierarchy: This refers to the levels of authority and reporting relationships within the organization. A clear hierarchy ensures that there is a defined chain of command and that each position knows who they report to and who reports to them.
  
  - Strategic Alignment: The position list should align with the strategic goals and objectives of the business. This ensures that each position contributes to the overall success of the business.
  
  - Talent Management: The position list informs talent management strategies, including recruitment, development, and retention. By understanding the roles, responsibilities, and hierarchy of positions, businesses can more effectively manage their talent.
  
  By understanding and optimizing these aspects of a "Position List", a business can create a more efficient and effective organizational structure. For instance, a manufacturing company might use a position list to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of its production team, ensuring that each step of the production process is accounted for and managed effectively. This would demonstrate the company's ability to leverage a "Position List" to drive its business model and create value.

- ## Description
  The concept of Finance in business modeling refers to the strategic management and allocation of financial resources within a business model. This involves the planning, organizing, controlling, and monitoring of financial resources to achieve the business objectives.
  
  In this model, the financial resources of a business are identified and quantified. These resources can include capital, revenues, investments, and other financial assets. The allocation of these resources is then planned and managed, based on the business's strategic goals and operational needs. This can involve decisions about investment, expenditure, savings, and fundraising.
  
  The purpose of the Finance model is to ensure that the business has sufficient financial resources to operate effectively and achieve its goals. It also aims to optimize the use of these resources, by allocating them in a way that maximizes the business's profitability and financial sustainability. This involves balancing the need for immediate expenditure, to support the business's operations and growth, with the need for long-term financial stability and resilience.
  
  For example, in a manufacturing company, the Finance model might involve decisions about how much to invest in new machinery, how much to spend on raw materials and labor, how much to save for future expansion, and how much to return to shareholders as dividends. These decisions would be based on a careful analysis of the company's financial resources, market conditions, business strategy, and risk tolerance.
  
  In essence, the Finance model is a critical aspect of business design. It provides a framework for making strategic financial decisions, managing financial risks, and ensuring the financial health and success of the business. It also interacts with other business modeling concepts, such as the Person (ID)/Functions model, by determining the financial resources available for each function and role within the business.

  The concept of "Cost Lines" in business modeling refers to the various expenses that a business incurs in the process of producing and delivering its products or services. These costs are an integral part of the business model, as they directly impact the profitability and financial sustainability of the business.
  
  Cost Lines can be categorized into different types, depending on the nature of the expense. For example, direct costs are those that are directly tied to the production of a product or service, such as raw materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Indirect costs, on the other hand, are not directly tied to production, but are necessary for the overall operation of the business, such as administrative expenses, marketing costs, and rent.
  
  In addition to these, there are also fixed costs, which remain constant regardless of the level of production, and variable costs, which change in proportion to the level of production. Understanding the different types of costs and how they behave is crucial for effective cost management and pricing strategies.
  
  For instance, in a restaurant business, the "Cost Lines" could include the cost of food ingredients (a direct and variable cost), the salaries of the chefs and waitstaff (a direct and fixed cost), the rent for the restaurant premises (an indirect and fixed cost), and the cost of advertising (an indirect and variable cost).
  
  In essence, the concept of "Cost Lines" in business modeling is about identifying, categorizing, and managing the various costs involved in running a business. This is a critical aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the business's bottom line and its ability to achieve financial sustainability and growth.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Unit Economics" in business modeling refers to the detailed financial analysis that focuses on the revenue and costs associated with a single unit of a product or service. This concept is crucial in understanding the profitability of a business on a per-unit basis, which can provide valuable insights into the overall financial health and sustainability of the business.
  
  Unit Economics involves calculating the direct revenues and costs associated with a single unit of a product or service, to determine the net value or profit margin per unit. This includes factors such as the selling price, the cost of goods sold (COGS), and any direct expenses related to the production, marketing, and delivery of the unit.
  
  For example, if a company sells a product for $100, and the cost of producing and delivering that product is $60, the unit economics would show a profit of $40 per unit. This information can be used to assess the profitability of the product, and to make strategic decisions about pricing, production, and marketing.
  
  Unit Economics is a powerful tool in business modeling, as it allows businesses to understand their cost structures and profit margins in detail. It can help businesses identify which products or services are most profitable, and where there may be opportunities to reduce costs or increase prices. It can also provide a benchmark for comparing the performance of different products, services, or business models.
  
  In conclusion, the concept of "Unit Economics" is a fundamental element in business design and modeling. It provides a detailed understanding of the financial performance of a business on a per-unit basis, and it can guide strategic decision-making and business planning.

- ## Description
  The concept of Funding Sources in business modeling refers to the diverse ways a business model generates revenue or acquires capital to support its operations. This concept is crucial as it directly impacts the financial sustainability and growth potential of a business.
  
  Funding Sources can be broadly categorized into two types: internal and external. Internal funding sources are generated within the business and include revenues from sales, profits retained in the business, and depreciation provisions. These sources are typically recurring and are closely linked to the business's operational performance.
  
  External funding sources, on the other hand, are funds obtained from outside the business. These can include equity capital from shareholders, loans from financial institutions, grants, and subsidies from government bodies, and investments from venture capitalists or angel investors. External funding sources are often used for significant business expansion or development projects.
  
  The choice of funding sources depends on various factors such as the business's stage of development, its financial health, the nature of its operations, and its strategic objectives. For instance, a startup might rely heavily on external funding sources like venture capital and angel investment, while a mature business might primarily use its internal funding sources.
  
  The Funding Sources model is a vital part of business design as it determines how a business finances its operations, invests in growth, and manages financial risks. It also influences other aspects of the business model, such as the value proposition, customer segments, and cost structure.
  
  For example, a software company might generate revenue through subscription fees (an internal funding source) and also raise capital through a series of funding rounds with venture capitalists (an external funding source). These funding sources would support the company's operations, fund its growth initiatives, and shape its business model.
  
  In summary, the Funding Sources model provides a framework for identifying, evaluating, and managing the various ways a business generates revenue or acquires capital. It is a critical component of business design, influencing the business's financial sustainability, growth potential, and overall business strategy.

  The concept of "Capital Structure" in business modeling refers to the mix of financial resources, assets, and investments that a business utilizes to generate income and support its operations. This structure is not randomly assembled, but strategically designed to optimize the financial performance and sustainability of the business.
  
  In a business model, the "Capital Structure" is a fundamental component as it determines how the business finances its overall operations and growth. It includes both debt and equity, which are the two primary sources of financing for any business. The balance between these two sources is crucial as it impacts the risk and return profile of the business.
  
  The composition of the "Capital Structure" can vary depending on the nature of the business, its financial strategy, and its risk tolerance. It can include resources such as retained earnings, equity shares, bonds, loans, or other forms of debt. Each component of the capital structure has a cost associated with it, and the goal is to minimize this cost to maximize the profitability of the business.
  
  For example, in a manufacturing business, the "Capital Structure" might include sources such as equity from shareholders, loans from banks for purchasing machinery and equipment, and retained earnings for reinvestment into the business. The balance between these sources is carefully managed to ensure the financial stability and growth of the business.
  
  The concept of "Capital Structure" in business modeling is not just about assembling the sources of financing. It's about strategically managing these resources to optimize the financial performance of the business. It's about creating a structure that can effectively support the business operations and contribute to its financial sustainability and growth.
  
  In conclusion, the "Capital Structure" concept in business modeling is a critical element that contributes to the financial success and sustainability of the business. It emphasizes the importance of strategically managing the financial resources, assets, and investments in a business model.

  The concept of "Cap Table" in business modeling refers to the detailed breakdown of a company's shareholders and the equity they hold. It is a critical component of a business's financial structure, as it outlines the ownership stakes, the type of equity each stakeholder holds, and the value of these equities.
  
  The Cap Table, short for Capitalization Table, includes all types of equity ownership in the company, such as common and preferred shares, options, warrants, and convertible notes. It also shows the potential dilution of ownership over time as more investors come in or employees exercise their stock options.
  
  For example, in a startup company, the Cap Table would initially list the founders as the primary shareholders. As the company grows and raises capital from investors, the Cap Table would be updated to include these new stakeholders and their respective ownership stakes. If the company also has an employee stock option plan (ESOP), the Cap Table would also reflect this and show the potential dilution of ownership if all options were exercised.
  
  The Cap Table is a dynamic document that changes over time as the company's equity structure evolves. It is a crucial tool for financial planning and decision-making, as it provides a clear picture of the company's ownership structure and the potential impact of future financing rounds or equity grants on existing shareholders.
  
  In essence, the concept of "Cap Table" in business modeling is about understanding and managing the equity ownership of a company. This is a vital aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the company's financial resources, its ability to attract and retain key talent, and its attractiveness to potential investors.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Financial Projections" in business modeling refers to the process of forecasting a company's future financial performance based on historical data, current economic conditions, and future expectations. These projections are used to estimate revenues, expenses, and profitability over a specific period, typically for the next fiscal year, but can also extend to five years or more.
  
  Financial projections are an essential part of a business plan, as they provide a quantitative measure of the expectations for the business. They are used by both internal management and external stakeholders, such as investors and lenders, to understand the potential financial outcomes of a business model.
  
  The process of creating financial projections involves several steps. First, the company must analyze its historical financial data to understand its past performance. This includes revenues, costs, and profitability, as well as any trends or patterns in the data.
  
  Next, the company must make assumptions about the future. This can include assumptions about market conditions, customer behavior, pricing, costs, and other factors that could impact financial performance. These assumptions should be based on thorough research and analysis, and they should be realistic and achievable.
  
  Finally, the company uses these assumptions to create a set of financial projections. These projections typically include an income statement, a balance sheet, and a cash flow statement. They provide a detailed picture of the company's expected financial performance, including revenues, expenses, net income, assets, liabilities, and cash flows.
  
  In conclusion, financial projections are a critical tool in business design and modeling. They provide a forward-looking view of a company's financial performance, based on a combination of historical data and future assumptions. They can help companies plan for the future, make strategic decisions, and attract investment.

- ## Description
  Cashflow projections in business modeling are a critical tool used to forecast the flow of cash into and out of a business over a specific period. This financial model provides an estimate of a company's future financial position and is a key component of business design. 
  
  Here are the key aspects of "Cashflow Projections" in business modeling:
  
  - Revenue Projections: This involves estimating the future sales of the business. This could be based on historical sales data, market research, or sales targets. The accuracy of revenue projections is crucial as it directly impacts the cash inflows.
  
  - Expense Projections: This involves forecasting the future costs of the business. This could include fixed costs such as rent and salaries, and variable costs such as raw materials and utilities. Accurate expense projections help to ensure that the business has sufficient cash to cover its outflows.
  
  - Cash Inflows and Outflows: This refers to the money coming into and going out of the business. Cash inflows could come from sales, loans, or investment, while cash outflows could include expenses, loan repayments, or dividends. Understanding the timing and amount of cash inflows and outflows is crucial for maintaining liquidity.
  
  - Cash Balance: This is the net amount of cash available to the business at any given time. It is calculated by subtracting the cash outflows from the cash inflows. A positive cash balance indicates that the business has sufficient cash to meet its obligations, while a negative cash balance could indicate a potential liquidity crisis.
  
  - Scenario Analysis: This involves creating multiple cashflow projections based on different scenarios. This could include a best-case scenario, a worst-case scenario, and a most likely scenario. Scenario analysis helps to prepare the business for different potential outcomes and mitigate financial risk.
  
  - Cashflow Management: This involves using the cashflow projections to make strategic decisions about the business. This could include adjusting pricing, managing costs, securing financing, or investing in growth. Effective cashflow management can help to ensure the financial sustainability and success of the business.
  
  For instance, a retail business might use cashflow projections to plan for seasonal fluctuations in sales and expenses. This would allow the business to manage its cash effectively, ensuring that it has sufficient cash to cover its expenses during slow periods and to invest in inventory and marketing during peak periods. This demonstrates the value of "Cashflow Projections" in driving the business model and ensuring financial sustainability.

- ## Description
  The concept of Legal in business modeling refers to the adherence of a business model to the laws and regulations that govern its operations and interactions with stakeholders. This concept is critical as it directly impacts the business's reputation, operational efficiency, and overall sustainability.
  
  Legal compliance in a business model involves ensuring that all business activities, from product development to marketing and sales, are conducted in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. This includes compliance with labor laws, environmental regulations, tax laws, data protection laws, and industry-specific regulations, among others.
  
  For instance, a pharmaceutical company must comply with stringent regulations regarding drug testing and approval, while a financial services firm must adhere to regulations related to customer data protection and financial reporting.
  
  Legal compliance is not just about avoiding penalties and lawsuits. It also plays a crucial role in maintaining a company's reputation and trustworthiness among its stakeholders, including customers, employees, investors, and the public. A business that is known for its strong commitment to legal compliance is more likely to attract and retain customers and investors, and to have a positive relationship with regulators.
  
  Moreover, a well-designed legal compliance system can also contribute to a company's operational efficiency and risk management. By identifying and addressing legal risks early, a company can avoid costly disruptions and crises down the line.
  
  For example, a manufacturing company might implement rigorous quality control procedures to ensure compliance with product safety regulations. This not only helps the company avoid legal penalties and product recalls, but also contributes to a reputation for high-quality products, thereby enhancing its competitive position.
  
  In summary, the Legal model in business design provides a framework for ensuring that a business operates in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. It is a critical component of business design, influencing the business's reputation, operational efficiency, risk management, and overall sustainability.

  For instance, a business operating in the healthcare sector needs to consider legal issues related to patient privacy laws, medical licensing requirements, and healthcare regulations. These legal issues will shape the business model, influencing decisions on operational processes, data management, and service delivery methods.
  
  Similarly, a tech startup would need to consider legal issues related to intellectual property rights, data protection laws, and possibly international trade regulations. These legal issues could influence the business model in terms of product development, market positioning, and revenue generation strategies.
  
  The concept of "Legal Issues" in business modeling is not just about identifying potential legal obstacles. It's about strategically navigating the legal landscape to ensure the business model is not only compliant but also resilient and competitive. It's about integrating legal considerations into the design and execution of the business model.
  
  In conclusion, the "Legal Issues" concept in business modeling is a critical element that contributes to the legal and operational success of the business. It emphasizes the importance of understanding and strategically managing the legal implications and obligations in a business model.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Phases" in business modeling refers to the distinct stages or steps involved in the development, implementation, and evolution of a business model. These phases are critical in shaping the business model and ensuring its success and sustainability. 
  
  Here are the key aspects of "Phases" in business modeling:
  
  - Idea Generation: This is the initial phase where the business idea is conceived. It involves identifying a market need, coming up with a unique solution, and defining the value proposition. This phase sets the foundation for the business model.
  
  - Business Model Design: This phase involves designing the business model that will deliver the value proposition. It includes defining the key activities, resources, partners, customer segments, channels, revenue streams, and cost structure. The business model design should align with the business strategy and objectives.
  
  - Implementation: This is the phase where the business model is put into action. It involves setting up the operations, building the product or service, establishing partnerships, and launching the marketing and sales activities. The success of the implementation phase is critical for the viability of the business model.
  
  - Evaluation: This phase involves assessing the performance of the business model. It includes tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), analyzing financial results, and gathering customer feedback. The evaluation phase provides insights into the effectiveness of the business model and identifies areas for improvement.
  
  - Evolution: This is the phase where the business model is adjusted based on the evaluation results. It could involve tweaking the value proposition, adjusting the revenue model, optimizing the cost structure, or pivoting the business model entirely. The evolution phase ensures that the business model remains relevant and competitive in the changing market conditions.
  
  For instance, a tech startup might go through these phases as follows: They identify a market need for a new type of software (Idea Generation), design a freemium business model to deliver this software (Business Model Design), develop and launch the software (Implementation), track user engagement and conversion rates (Evaluation), and introduce a premium subscription tier based on user feedback (Evolution). This demonstrates the value of "Phases" in driving the business model and ensuring its success and sustainability.

- ## Description
  The concept of Milestones in business modeling refers to the significant achievements or events that indicate substantial progress or success in a business model. These milestones serve as markers that help businesses track their progress towards their strategic goals and objectives.
  
  Milestones can be diverse and depend on the nature and stage of the business. For instance, for a startup, milestones could include securing initial funding, launching a prototype, acquiring the first 100 customers, or reaching a certain revenue target. For an established business, milestones could involve expanding into a new market, launching a new product line, achieving a certain market share, or reaching a specific sales or profit target.
  
  Milestones are crucial in business modeling for several reasons. Firstly, they provide a clear roadmap for the business, helping to guide strategic planning and decision-making. By setting clear, measurable milestones, businesses can better plan their activities and resources to achieve these targets.
  
  Secondly, milestones serve as a motivational tool. Achieving a milestone can boost morale and motivation within the team, reinforcing the belief in the business's vision and strategy.
  
  Thirdly, milestones are a powerful communication tool with external stakeholders. For investors, milestones provide tangible evidence of a business's progress and potential, helping to build confidence and trust in the business. For customers, milestones can demonstrate a business's commitment to continuous improvement and customer satisfaction.
  
  Lastly, milestones can also serve as a risk management tool. If a business is consistently failing to meet its milestones, it may indicate underlying problems that need to be addressed. This can help businesses identify and mitigate risks early, preventing potential crises down the line.
  
  In summary, the Milestones model in business design provides a framework for setting, tracking, and achieving significant achievements or events that indicate substantial progress or success in a business model. It is a critical component of business design, influencing strategic planning, motivation, communication with stakeholders, and risk management.

It may also include testimonials from satisfied customers, case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the company's solutions, and contact information for further inquiries.
  
  The design and content of a business brochure should be carefully crafted to appeal to its target audience. This involves understanding the needs and preferences of potential customers, and presenting the company's offerings in a way that resonates with them. The brochure should be visually appealing, easy to read, and concise, while providing enough information to convince potential customers of the value of the company's products or services.
  
  In addition to its role as a marketing tool, a business brochure can also serve as a tool for business modeling. It can help the company to define its value proposition, identify its target market, and develop its marketing strategy. It can also provide insights into the competitive landscape, helping the company to position itself effectively in the market.
  
  In conclusion, a business brochure is a versatile tool in business design and modeling. It serves as a marketing tool, a representation of the company's brand, and a source of insights for business modeling. It is a critical component of a successful business model, helping to attract and inform potential customers, and contributing to the company's overall marketing strategy.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Web" in business modeling refers to the digital presence or online platform of a business model, which includes websites, social media, and other online channels. This concept is crucial in today's digital age, where businesses are increasingly leveraging the internet to reach and engage with their customers.
  
  Here are the key aspects of "Web" in business modeling:
  
  - Website Development: This involves creating a website that serves as the digital storefront of the business. The website should be designed to effectively communicate the business's value proposition, showcase its products or services, and facilitate customer transactions.
  
  - Social Media Presence: This involves establishing a presence on social media platforms where the business's target customers are active. Social media can be used to engage with customers, share content, promote products or services, and build brand awareness.
  
  - Online Marketing: This involves leveraging online channels to market the business's products or services. This could include search engine optimization (SEO), pay-per-click advertising (PPC), email marketing, content marketing, and more.
  
  - E-commerce: For businesses that sell products, this involves setting up an online store or using third-party e-commerce platforms. This allows customers to purchase products directly from the business's website.
  
  - Analytics and Optimization: This involves tracking and analyzing the performance of the business's online activities. This data can provide valuable insights into customer behavior, website performance, and the effectiveness of online marketing efforts. These insights can be used to optimize the business's online strategy and improve its performance.
  
  For instance, a retail business might use the "Web" concept in its business model as follows: They develop an e-commerce website to sell their products (Website Development), establish a presence on Instagram and Facebook to engage with their customers (Social Media Presence), use SEO and PPC to drive traffic to their website (Online Marketing), sell products through their website (E-commerce), and use Google Analytics to track their website performance and optimize their online marketing efforts (Analytics and Optimization). This demonstrates the importance of the "Web" concept in reaching and engaging with customers in the digital age.

- ## Description
  The concept of Storytelling in business modeling refers to the strategic and purposeful use of narrative techniques to communicate a brand's purpose, values, and mission to its customers. This approach is rooted in the understanding that humans are naturally drawn to stories, and that stories can be a powerful tool for creating emotional connections, conveying complex ideas, and inspiring action.
  
  In the context of business design, storytelling can take many forms. It could be the brand's founding story that illustrates its mission and values, customer success stories that demonstrate the value of its products or services, or future-oriented stories that paint a vision of what the brand aims to achieve.
  
  Storytelling serves several key functions in business modeling. Firstly, it helps to humanize the brand, making it more relatable and engaging to customers. By sharing stories that resonate with customers' experiences, aspirations, or values, brands can build stronger emotional connections and loyalty.
  
  Secondly, storytelling can simplify and clarify the brand's value proposition. By weaving the brand's products or services into a compelling narrative, brands can help customers understand what they offer, why it matters, and how it differs from competitors.
  
  Thirdly, storytelling can inspire and mobilize action. Whether it's a call to purchase, share, join, or advocate, a well-crafted story can motivate customers to take the desired action, driving business growth and impact.
  
  Lastly, storytelling can shape and reinforce the brand's culture and identity. The stories a brand tells - both internally and externally - can help define what it stands for, how it operates, and how it perceives and interacts with the world.
  
  In summary, the Storytelling model in business design is a strategic approach that uses narrative techniques to communicate a brand's purpose, values, and mission, build emotional connections, clarify its value proposition, inspire action, and shape its culture and identity. It is a powerful tool for enhancing brand perception, customer engagement, and business performance.

It includes elements such as the brand's history, vision, mission, values, personality, and customer promise. The framework guides businesses in telling their story in a way that resonates with their target audience and differentiates them from their competitors.
  
  - [[Hero's Journey]]
    - The Hero's Journey, or the Monomyth, is a narrative pattern identified by Joseph Campbell that appears in drama, storytelling, myth, religious ritual, and psychological development. It describes the typical adventure of the archetype known as The Hero, the person who goes out and achieves great deeds on behalf of the group, tribe, or civilization. Businesses can use this pattern to structure their brand storytelling, positioning their customers as the heroes and themselves as the guides.
  
  - [[StoryBrand Framework]]
    - Developed by Donald Miller, the StoryBrand Framework is a 7-part storytelling tool that helps businesses clarify their brand message.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Analysis" in business modeling refers to the systematic examination and evaluation of the various components of a business model. This process is crucial in identifying the significance and coherence of each element, as well as determining the potential risks associated with the model.
  
  During the analysis phase, each aspect of the business model is scrutinized. This includes the value proposition, customer segments, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, and cost structure. The goal is to understand how these components interact with each other and contribute to the overall functioning of the business.
  
  For instance, a company might analyze its business model to assess the viability of a new product. This would involve examining the product's potential market, the competition, the proposed revenue streams, the necessary resources and activities, and the potential costs. The analysis might reveal that while the product has a large potential market, the competition is fierce and the cost structure is high, making the product risky.
  
  The analysis phase is not only about identifying potential risks, but also about finding opportunities for improvement and innovation. It can reveal inefficiencies in the business model, areas for cost reduction, potential new revenue streams, and opportunities for better serving customers.
  
  In essence, the concept of "Analysis" in business modeling is about understanding a business model in depth. It is a critical aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the ability of a business to mitigate risks, seize opportunities, and ultimately, achieve success.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Assumption List" in business modeling refers to a list of hypotheses or beliefs that the entrepreneurial team holds to be true and relevant to their business. These assumptions are often based on the team's understanding of the market, the customer, the product or service, and the business environment. They serve as the foundation upon which the business model is built and are used to guide decision-making and strategy development.
  
  Here are the key aspects of "Assumption List" in business modeling:
  
  - Market Assumptions: These are assumptions about the market in which the business operates, including the size of the market, the growth rate, the level of competition, and the market trends. For example, a startup might assume that the market for their product is growing at a rate of 10% per year.
  
  - Customer Assumptions: These are assumptions about the customers that the business serves, including their needs, preferences, behaviors, and willingness to pay. For example, a business might assume that their customers value quality over price.
  
  - Product or Service Assumptions: These are assumptions about the product or service that the business offers, including its functionality, value proposition, and competitive advantage. For example, a tech company might assume that their software is more user-friendly than the competition.
  
  - Business Environment Assumptions: These are assumptions about the broader business environment, including the regulatory environment, the economic environment, and the technological environment. For example, a business might assume that there will be no significant regulatory changes in the next few years.
  
  - Financial Assumptions: These are assumptions about the financial aspects of the business, including the cost structure, the revenue model, and the profitability. For example, a business might assume that their cost of goods sold will decrease over time due to economies of scale.
  
  It's important to note that while assumptions are necessary to move forward with a business model, they should be validated or invalidated as soon as possible through market research, customer feedback, and other forms of testing. This helps to reduce risk and uncertainty, and allows the business to adapt its model based on real-world evidence.

- ## Tools
  - [[Lean Startup Methodology]]
    - The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, heavily emphasizes the importance of making assumptions and then testing them. The assumption list is a key component of this methodology. The entrepreneurial team lists their assumptions about their business model and then designs experiments to validate or invalidate these assumptions.
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - While the Business Model Canvas does not explicitly include an assumption list, it is often used in conjunction with one. The entrepreneurial team can list their assumptions about each of the nine components of the canvas and then test these assumptions through customer discovery and validation.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - Similar to the Business Model Canvas, the Value Proposition Canvas can be used in conjunction with an assumption list. The entrepreneurial team can make assumptions about the customer profile and value map and then test these assumptions.
  - [[Customer Development Model]]
    - The Customer Development Model, developed by Steve Blank, is a four-step framework that emphasizes the importance of making and testing assumptions. The assumption list is a key component of the first step, customer discovery.
  - [[Pivot or Persevere]]
    - This tool, also from the Lean Startup methodology, is used after assumptions have been tested. If an assumption is invalidated, the entrepreneurial team must decide whether to pivot (change a fundamental part of the business model) or persevere (keep testing the current model). The assumption list is a critical input to this decision.
  - [[Assumption Mapping]]
    - This tool, developed by David Bland, is specifically designed to help teams identify and test their riskiest assumptions. The assumption list is a key component of this tool. The team lists their assumptions and then maps them based on their level of uncertainty and the impact on the business if the assumption is wrong.

- ## Description
  The concept of a Risk List in business modeling refers to the identification and documentation of potential negative outcomes or uncertainties that may affect the success and sustainability of a business model. This concept is rooted in the understanding that every business operates in an environment of uncertainty and risk, and that proactive risk management is crucial for business survival and growth.
  
  In the context of business design, a Risk List can take many forms. It could be a list of potential market risks such as changes in customer preferences, competitive threats, or regulatory changes. It could also include operational risks such as supply chain disruptions, technology failures, or talent shortages. Financial risks such as currency fluctuations, interest rate changes, or liquidity issues may also be included. 
  
  The Risk List serves several key functions in business modeling. Firstly, it helps to identify and prioritize risks, enabling businesses to focus their resources and efforts on the most significant threats. By understanding the potential impact and likelihood of each risk, businesses can make informed decisions about risk mitigation strategies.
  
  Secondly, a Risk List can facilitate proactive risk management. By identifying potential risks early, businesses can take steps to prevent or reduce their impact, rather than reacting to them after they occur. This can enhance business resilience, reduce costs, and protect business value.
  
  Thirdly, a Risk List can enhance strategic planning and decision-making. By considering potential risks in their strategic planning, businesses can develop more robust and resilient strategies that take into account the full range of uncertainties they face.
  
  Lastly, a Risk List can improve stakeholder communication and trust. By transparently communicating about potential risks and their management strategies, businesses can build trust with stakeholders, including investors, customers, employees, and regulators.
  
  In summary, the Risk List model in business design is a strategic approach that involves identifying, documenting, and managing potential negative outcomes or uncertainties that may affect the success and sustainability of a business model. It is a crucial tool for enhancing business resilience, strategic planning, stakeholder communication, and overall business performance.

- ## Tools
  - [[Risk Management Plan]]
    - A Risk Management Plan is a document that a project manager prepares to foresee risks, estimate impacts, and define responses to issues. It also contains a risk assessment matrix. A risk is "an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives." This tool is used to identify potential risks in the early stages of a project and is a part of the overall project management plan.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) is a strategic planning tool used to identify and analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats involved in a project or business. It can be used to identify potential risks (threats) that could negatively affect the business model.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - The PESTEL Analysis (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal) is a framework or tool used by marketers to analyze and monitor the macro-environmental factors that have an impact on an organization. By understanding these external environments, businesses can maximize the opportunities and minimize the threats to the organization.
  - [[Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)]]
    - The Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) is a hierarchical representation of risks according to their risk categories. This tool is used in risk management to help identify and manage potential risks associated with a project or business.
  - [[Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)]]
    - Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a step-by-step approach for identifying all possible failures in a design, a manufacturing or assembly process, or a product or service. It is a common tool for risk assessment and is used to identify potential failure modes, determine their effect on the operation of the product, and identify actions to mitigate the failures.
  - [[Monte Carlo Simulation]]
    - Monte Carlo Simulation is a computerized mathematical technique that allows people to account for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making. It provides a range of possible outcomes and the probabilities they will occur for any choice of action. It shows the extreme possibilities—the outcomes of going for broke and for the most conservative decision—along with all possible consequences for middle-of-the-road decisions.

  Business appraisals, in the context of business modeling, refer to the systematic evaluation and determination of the economic value of a business entity or its assets. This process is crucial in various business scenarios such as mergers and acquisitions, business sales, investment analysis, and strategic planning.
  
  The appraisal process involves a comprehensive analysis of the business's financial statements, market conditions, industry trends, and other relevant factors. It may also include the use of various valuation methods such as discounted cash flow analysis, comparable company analysis, and asset-based approaches.
  
  For instance, in a merger or acquisition scenario, a business appraisal would be conducted to determine the fair market value of the target company. This would involve analyzing the company's financial performance, growth prospects, competitive position, and other factors. The appraisal would provide a basis for negotiating the purchase price and other terms of the deal.
  
  Similarly, in an investment analysis scenario, a business appraisal would be conducted to assess the potential return on investment. This would involve evaluating the company's profitability, risk profile, and investment opportunities. The appraisal would help investors make informed decisions about whether to invest in the company.
  
  In a strategic planning scenario, a business appraisal would be conducted to guide the company's strategic decisions. This would involve assessing the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The appraisal would provide insights into the company's competitive advantage, market position, and growth potential.
  
  In conclusion, business appraisals in business modeling are a critical process that provides a robust, objective, and reliable assessment of a business's value. They play a key role in facilitating informed decision-making, strategic planning, and value creation.

  - [[Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis]]
    - The DCF analysis is a method used in finance to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. This method is often used in business appraisals to determine the value of a company or its assets. The DCF analysis takes into account the time value of money, meaning that it considers the fact that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity.
  - [[Comparable Company Analysis (CCA)]]
    - This method involves comparing the company in question to similar businesses within the same industry. The comparison is typically based on certain valuation ratios, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), or price-to-book (P/B). This method is often used in business appraisals to determine the market value of a company or its assets.
  - [[Net Asset Value (NAV) Method]]
    - The NAV method is used in business appraisals to determine the value of a company based on its net assets. This method involves subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets. The result is the net asset value, which represents the company's intrinsic worth.
  - [[Economic Value Added (EVA)]]
    - EVA is a measure of a company's financial performance based on the residual wealth calculated by deducting the cost of capital from its operating profit. This method is often used in business appraisals to determine the economic value of a company or its assets.
  - [[Market Capitalization]]
    - Market capitalization is the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying a company's shares outstanding by the current market price of one share. This method is often used in business appraisals to determine the market value of a publicly-traded company.

- ## Description
  The concept of "Validation" in business modeling refers to the process of testing and verifying the assumptions and hypotheses that underpin a business model. This process is essential in ensuring that the business model is based on accurate and realistic assumptions, and that it is capable of delivering the expected results.
  
  During the validation phase, the assumptions and hypotheses of the business model are put to the test. This could involve conducting market research to validate customer segments and value propositions, running financial simulations to verify revenue streams and cost structures, or carrying out pilot projects to test key activities and partnerships.
  
  For example, a company might validate its business model by launching a minimum viable product (MVP) to a small segment of its target market. The feedback and data gathered from this MVP launch can then be used to validate or invalidate the assumptions about the product's market fit, pricing strategy, and customer acquisition channels. If the assumptions are validated, the company can proceed with confidence. If they are invalidated, the company can pivot and adjust its business model based on the new insights.
  
  The validation phase is not only about confirming the viability of a business model, but also about learning and adapting. It allows businesses to learn from their mistakes, adapt their strategies, and continuously improve their business models.
  
  In essence, the concept of "Validation" in business modeling is about ensuring that a business model is grounded in reality and capable of delivering success. It is a critical aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the ability of a business to survive, thrive, and grow in a competitive market.

- ## Tools
  - [[Lean Startup Methodology]]
    - Developed by Eric Ries, the Lean Startup Methodology emphasizes the importance of validating business models through a build-measure-learn feedback loop. This involves creating a minimum viable product (MVP), measuring how it performs in the market, and learning from the results to iterate or pivot the business model.
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - The Business Model Canvas, while not specifically focused on validation, can be used as a tool for this purpose. By mapping out the key components of a business model, it allows for a comprehensive view that can be used to identify assumptions and hypotheses that need to be tested.
  - [[Customer Development]]
    - This methodology, developed by Steve Blank, is focused on understanding customer needs and validating business model assumptions through customer interaction. It involves four steps: customer discovery, customer validation, customer creation, and company building.
  - [[Experiment Board]]
    - The Experiment Board is a tool developed by Javelin that helps entrepreneurs to validate their business ideas. It guides them through the process of identifying their riskiest assumptions, designing experiments to test these assumptions, and interpreting the results.
  - [[Value Proposition Design]]
    - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is focused on designing and testing value propositions. It can be used to validate the value proposition component of a business model by helping to understand the fit between the product or service and customer needs.
  - [[Pivot or Persevere]]
    - This is a decision-making process used in the Lean Startup Methodology. After a cycle of building, measuring, and learning, entrepreneurs need to decide whether to pivot (make a fundamental change to the business model) or persevere (keep testing the current business model). This decision is based on the validation (or lack thereof) of the business model's assumptions.
  - [[Assumption Mapping]]
    - This tool, developed by David J Bland, helps teams to identify and test their riskiest assumptions. It involves creating a map of assumptions, categorizing them based on their risk and uncertainty, and then designing experiments to test the riskiest assumptions.

  The concept of "Experiment (ID)" in business modeling refers to the systematic process of testing and validating the assumptions and hypotheses that underpin a business model. These experiments are designed to provide empirical evidence about the viability of the business model's value proposition, customer segments, and revenue streams. 
  
  Here are the key aspects of "Experiment (ID)" in business modeling:
  
  - Hypothesis Testing: This involves formulating specific, testable predictions based on the business model's assumptions. For example, if a business assumes that customers value quality over price, an experiment might be designed to test whether customers are willing to pay a premium for a higher-quality product.
  
  - Data Collection: This involves gathering data to test the hypotheses. This could involve a variety of methods, including customer surveys, market research, A/B testing, and sales data analysis.
  
  - Analysis: This involves analyzing the data to determine whether the hypotheses are supported or refuted. For example, if the data shows that customers are not willing to pay a premium for a higher-quality product, this would refute the hypothesis and suggest that the business model needs to be adjusted.
  
  - Iteration: This involves using the results of the experiments to refine and improve the business model. If an assumption is validated, it can be incorporated into the business model with greater confidence. If an assumption is invalidated, the business model needs to be adjusted accordingly.
  
  - Learning: The ultimate goal of these experiments is to learn more about the market, the customers, and the business environment. This learning can then be used to make more informed decisions and to develop a more effective and successful business model.
  
  In essence, the "Experiment (ID)" concept in business modeling is about reducing uncertainty and risk by systematically testing and validating the assumptions that underpin a business model. It's about learning and adapting based on empirical evidence, rather than simply relying on beliefs or guesses.

  - ### #[[goal]]
    - #goal [[Build a business based on the principles of iterative product development, validated learning, and continuous improvement]]
  - ### Description
    - Lean Startup is a methodology developed by Eric Ries that aims to build businesses in a more efficient and effective way. It is based on the principles of iterative product development, validated learning, and continuous improvement. The Lean Startup approach emphasizes the importance of testing assumptions, gathering feedback from customers, and making data-driven decisions. By following this methodology, startups can reduce the risk of failure and increase their chances of success.
  - ### Key principles
    - #### Iterative product development
      - Instead of spending a long time developing a product or service in isolation, the Lean Startup approach encourages startups to build a minimum viable product (MVP) and quickly release it to the market. This allows for early feedback and iteration based on real-world usage.
    - #### Validated learning
      - The Lean Startup methodology emphasizes the importance of learning from customer feedback and data. Startups should focus on validating their assumptions and hypotheses through experiments and measurements. This helps to reduce uncertainty and make_informed decisions.
    - #### Continuous improvement
      - The Lean Startup approach encourages startups to continuously improve their products, services, and business models based on feedback and data. This involves regularly testing and iterating on ideas, and being open to pivoting or changing direction if necessary.
  - ### Key activities
    - #### Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop
      - The core of the Lean Startup methodology is the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. Startups should build a minimum viable product, measure its performance and customer feedback, and learn from the results. This feedback loop helps to validate assumptions, identify improvements, and guide the next iteration.
    - #### Validated learning through experiments
      - Startups should conduct experiments to test their assumptions and gather data. These experiments can take various forms, such as problem interviews, solution interviews, A___B testing, or pilot programs. The goal is to validate or invalidate hypotheses and make data-driven decisions.
    - #### Pivot or persevere
      - Based on the insights gained from experiments and validated learning, startups should be willing to pivot or persevere. If the data suggests that the current approach is not working, startups should be open to changing direction or exploring new opportunities. Conversely, if the data supports the current approach, startups should persevere and double down on their efforts.
  - ### Benefits
    - The Lean Startup methodology offers several benefits for startups, including:
      -   - Reducing the risk of failure by validating assumptions and hypotheses early on
      -   - Saving time and resources by focusing on building a minimum viable product and iterating based on feedback
      -   - Increasing the chances of success by making data-driven decisions and continuously improving the product or service
      -   - Building a strong understanding of the target market and customer needs through validated learning
      -   - Creating a culture of experimentation and innovation within the startup
  - ### Challenges
    - Implementing the Lean Startup methodology can also present challenges for startups, including:
      -   - Balancing the need for speed and iteration with the need for quality and reliability
      -   - Overcoming resistance to change and embracing a culture of experimentation
      -   - Managing limited resources and prioritizing experiments and improvements
      -   - Dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity in the early stages of the startup
      -   - Maintaining focus and avoiding the temptation to chase multiple ideas or opportunities simultaneously

  - The company behind the Vein Viewer, an innovative medical device, developed a business model that focuses on addressing the medical needs of patients and the clinical workforce.
   The Vein Viewer is designed to locate veins in patients, especially in cases where it's challenging due to obesity or other factors. This is known as difficult venous access (DVA).
   The device is particularly useful in reducing the pain and complications that patients experience during needle sticks for vascular access.
   One of the significant innovations of the Vein Viewer is its high-definition imaging and advanced digital full field technology.
   It uses a reflective, infrared technology, emitting harmless LED light, which is absorbed by the blood and reflected by surrounding tissues.
   This technology allows medical professionals to easily locate veins, understanding the patient's blood pattern up to 15 mm deep, with 10 mm being sufficient for medical purposes.
   It prevents patients from receiving accidental punctures during attempts to find veins and projects an image of the patient’s vasculature with exact anatomical locations.
   This not only ensures a safer procedure of vascular access for patients and healthcare workers but also represents a significant advancement in medical science.
   For the business model, the company used the Business Model Canvas as a tool for launching the Vein Viewer Flex to the market.
   The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management tool that provides a visual framework for developing, describing, and analyzing a company's business model, including key partners, activities, resources, value propositions, customer relationships, channels, customer segments, cost structure, and revenue streams.
   This tool was chosen for its capability to manage multiple aspects of model development in a well-structured manner​1​.

Research and development: The company invests in scientific research and technological development to understand and manipulate the DNA of extinct animals. They employ biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques to reconstruct the genomes of these species and recreate their distinctive characteristics.

Cloning and reproduction: Once the complete genome of an extinct animal has been obtained, the company uses cloning and assisted reproduction techniques to create living individuals of the species. This involves transferring the reconstructed DNA to stem cells or eggs of related living animals, such as elephants or cows, to produce embryos that are then implanted into surrogate females for gestation.

Care and maintenance: The company establishes facilities and care centers to house and breed the revived extinct animals. They employ veterinary and biology specialists to ensure that the animals are well taken care of and provided with an appropriate environment for their development.

Production and marketing of luxury meat: Once the animals have reached maturity, the company proceeds with meat production. The animals are ethically and respectfully slaughtered following established standards. The meat is processed, packaged with high-quality standards, and then marketed in the luxury food market. The company focuses on attracting consumers willing to pay a premium price for an exclusive and unique gastronomic experience.

Marketing and sales: The company implements marketing strategies to promote the story and value of its products, highlighting its innovative and sustainable approach. They use selective sales channels, such as high-end restaurants and specialized stores, to reach their target audience.

Sustainability and regulation: The company is committed to operating sustainably and ethically. They collaborate with experts in biodiversity conservation and work closely with regulatory authorities to ensure that their activities comply with all legal and ethical regulations related to biotechnology and genetic engineering.

It's important to note that the viability and acceptance of this business model may be subject to ethical, environmental, and regulatory considerations.

innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Identify the risks.md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Una vez diseñado el modelo de negocio candidato, nos centraremos en tratar de identificar los motivos que puedan dar al traste con el proyecto empresarial. Por ello es muy importante identificar los riesgos, de forma que me permita saber por dónde empezar a desarrollar mi proyecto.Para identificar las hipótesis contenidas en nuestro modelo de negocio, una vez hayamos realizado la versión inicial del lienzo de negocio, daremos un paso atrás para verlo con perspectiva, y nos haremos la siguiente pregunta:¿Qué estoy suponiendo que es cierto para que pueda funcionar este negocio?Casi todos los post-it que tengamos en el modelo de negocio llevarán implícita una o varias hipótesis.Por ejemplo si estoy pensando en crear un periódico en el que los contenidos van a ser generados por voluntarios a cambio de obtener visibilidad como profesionales, lo consideraré una hipótesis, ya que puede suceder que no les resulte una propuesta interesante.El grado de riesgo asociado a cada hipótesis dependerá del en gran medida del conocimiento que tenga del mercado al que me dirijo. No es lo mismo que la hipótesis anterior sea planteada por un profesional que ha sido alto ejecutivo de periódicos durante 20 años y que luego a desarrollado una carrera como consultor con durante 15, a que la plantee un estudiante de 2º de Bellas Artes. Obviamente hay mucha más incertidumbre en este segundo caso.Lo que plantea Steve Blank es identificar a nuestros clientes potenciales, salir a la calle e interactuar con ellos a través de conversaciones, entrevistas, encuestas, etc... para validar que lo que tenemos en la cabeza, y estamos suponiendo que piensan, es efectivamente correcto.Es absolutamente normal que varias de las hipótesis que tenemos acerca de nuestro público objetivo resulten no ser ciertas y haya que cambiar el modelo de negocio. Si el cambio es moderado y se trata de ajuste, fino lo realizaremos con facilidad. Pero si alguna de las hipótesis principales de nuestro modelo de negocio resulta no ser cierta, entonces tendremos que pivotar , es decir, aplicar un cambio sustancial al modelo de negocio o, incluso, descartarlo.Descartar a tiempo un proyecto empresarial puede considerarse un “éxito con minúsculas”, ya que se ha empleado poco tiempo y recursos para comprobar que esa idea no va a ningún sitio. El emprendedor no debe contemplar este escenario como trágico, ya que muchas veces solamente los conocimientos generados y la experiencia acumulada al intentar poner en marcha un negocio justifican con creces el esfuerzo, tiempo e ilusión empleados.Hay que ser conscientes de que lo que de verdad es un fracaso es intentar poner en marcha durante un año un proyecto que no va a ningún lado, y que hubiera sido posible descartar en caso de haber aplicado correctamente el desarrollo de clientes.Todas las hipótesis que encontremos llevan asociados riesgos, ya que si resultan no ser ciertas, es bastante probable que nuestro modelo de negocio no funcione.Una de las formas de desperdicio de tiempo dinero y esfuerzo principales en un proyecto emprendedor es la incorrecta priorización de tareas. Comenzaremos por definir dos conceptos importantes:<ul><li>incertidumbre: es la falta de certeza total, es decir la existencia de más de una posibilidad</li></ul><li>riesgo: un estado de incertidumbre donde algunas de las posibilidades suponen consecuencias indeseables</li></ul>Una vez identificados los riesgos es necesario cuantificarlos para entender el impacto potencial que pueden tener en nuestro negocio. Para cuantificarlos se tendrán en cuenta dos aspectos:<ul><li>La probabilidad de que suceda</li></ul><li>Las pérdidas que generaría en caso de que suceda (tanto en términos de costes reales como de costes de oportunidad)</li></ul> Durante el análisis de los riesgos del modelo de negocio intentaré establecer:<ul><li>Estrategias de mitigación, es decir pensar de qué formas puedo eliminar esos riesgos. Generalmente esto lo conseguiremos diseñando y ejecutando experimentos.</li></ul><li>Estrategias de contingencia, que consisten en planificar lo que voy hacer en caso de que un riesgo no se pueda mitigar y tenga lugar. Por ejemplo, esto sucede en los riesgos asociados a la posible reacción de la competencia. Hay siempre un riesgo asociado a que la competencia esté trabajando en un proyecto similar al mío y lo ponga en marcha en un futuro con más recursos y con un punto de partida más ventajoso. Esto sería un riesgo que es muy difícil de mitigar, ya que generalmente no podremos obtener_información acerca de este tipo de proyectos, y lo que tengo que hacer es construir una estrategia de contingencia para saber cómo reaccionar en caso de que esto suceda.</li></ul>


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Validation - Risk classification.md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Steve Blank plantea que existen dos tipos de riesgo a la hora de poner en marcha un proyecto empresarial:<ul><li>El primero es el riesgo técnico, qué consiste en no ser capaz de desarrollar un producto o servicio debido a la complejidad técnica del mismo. Un ejemplo de empresas que tienen un riesgo técnico muy alto son los laboratorios farmacéuticos que ponen en marcha programas para sacar al mercado nuevas moléculas, pero que se basan en proyectos de investigación que pueden dar resultados o no.</li></ul><li>El otro riesgo es el riesgo de mercado, qué es el de no encontrar suficientes clientes como para sostener mi negocio, que los mismos no estén dispuestos a pagar un precio suficiente como para que yo pueda operar en rentabilidad, o que no seamos capaces de encontrar los canales adecuados para llegar a un número suficiente de clientes a un coste razonable.</li></ul>Steve Blank se plantea: si en la mayor parte de proyectos empresariales el riesgo de mercado es muy superior al riesgo técnico ¿porque los emprendedores se empeñan primero en desarrollar el producto y mitigar el riesgo técnico antes de intentar mitigar el riesgo de mercado?Los riesgos en general se pueden clasificar en tres categorías:<ul><li>Riesgo de producto: lo que él ha asociado a conseguir el producto correcto.</li></ul><li>Riesgo de clientes: el asociada a conseguir llegar a los clientes.</li><li>Riesgo de mercado: el asociado a construir un negocio viable.</li></ul>Existe alguna a ver una serie de riesgos que son habituales y comunes en cualquier empresa que se ponga en marcha y en concreto en las startups. Generalmente es recomendable, sobre todo en la etapa inicial de un negocio, centrarse en los riesgos de mercado, que son los que de forma más habitual suponen el fracaso de una start-up.

- ### Es muy importante salir del edificio cuanto antes y contrastar la idea de negocio con gente distinta a ti mismo. Por lo general tu modelo de negocio candidato se puede contrastar con dos tipos de personas:<ul><li>Tus clientes potenciales</li></ul><li>Personas que conozcan bien a tus clientes potenciales</li></ul>En una etapa inicial tiene más sentido empezar a contrastar el modelo de negocio con personas que conozcan bien a tus clientes potenciales, que además puedes convertir en asesores de forma más o menos formal para que te ayuden a lo largo del proyecto. Un buen asesor te puede ayudar a identificar riesgos que no hayas tenido en cuenta y entender mejor, en función del feedback que te aporte, las posibilidades de éxito de cada uno de los modelos de negocio potenciales.Algunas de las mejores prácticas para llevar a cabo estas entrevistas iniciales son las siguientes:

- ### Lo que te digan tus consejeros o clientes potenciales son sólo opiniones, que además muchas veces seran contradictorias entre sí. Uno de los peores errores que puede cometer un emprendedor es tratar de aplicar todos los consejos que ha recibido. Las opiniones son sólo un conjunto de ideas que le vienen a la cabeza a los entrevistados sin pasar ningún filtro, y es responsabilidad del emprendedor destilar a aquellas útiles de aquellas que no lo son. Hay que tener siempre en cuenta que muchos de los consejos se emiten después de haber descrito el proyecto al entrevistado en un par de minutos. Muchas veces (especialmente si el proyecto es complejo y todavía no lo explicamos muy bien) es posible que la capacidad de nuestro interlocutor para entender de qué le hablamos sea similar a la de Justin Bieber para entender la Teoría del Entrelazamiento Cuántico si se la explicamos gesticulando. Seguramente sus consejos serían distintos si se conocieran más en profundidad los detalles del negocio.

- ### En esta primera etapa es una buena idea tener un equipo pequeño formado por dos o tres personas que puedan tomar decisiones de forma ágil, y que generalmente serán los fundadores de la empresa.En caso de que sólo haya un fundador de la empresa, que está emprendiendo en solitario, tendrá que llevar a cabo el todas las tareas descritas a continuación. Aún así es una buena idea intentar contar con alguien externo que te ayude con sus opiniones acerca del trabajo que vas haciendo, como puede ser un asesor o un emprendedor que conozcas.En general para poder llevar a cabo la fase de validación del problema y la solución deberás tener en el equipo o emprendedor cubiertas las siguientes habilidades:<ul><li>Alguien capaz de ir desarrollando el producto</li></ul><li>Alguien que sepa de diseño y experiencia de usuario</li><li>Alguien que sepa de marketing y comunicación</li></ul>No suele ser una buena idea subcontratar estos perfiles en esta fase del ciclo de vida de la empresa, ya que es necesario tener visión de conjunto y una involucración a nivel de negocio más allá de la función específica asignada. Además son numerosísimas las experiencias de emprendedores en las que subcontratar estos servicios ha supuesto un dolor de cabeza y unos gastos considerables, sin obtener el resultado esperado. Nunca un proveedor externo se va a tomar tan en serio su trabajo como tú y hay que tener en cuenta que no es el único trabajo que están haciendo, y es habitual que no se cumplan las fechas de entrega.

Cuando hagas referencia, por ejemplo, al tamaño del mercado, no digas que el mercado es enorme, sino que el mercado está compuesto por más de 25 millones de personas (y justifícalo con referencias).

Se trata de convertir las hipótesis que hemos incluido en el modelo de negocio (en las cajas segmentos de clientes y problema) en hipótesis falsables, es decir que una vez ejecutado el experimento resulten verdaderas o falsas.

- ### El terreno previo al ajuste producto mercado está lleno de aprendizaje cualitativo. Puedes mitigar los riesgos en alguna medida, pero no se pueden eliminar del todo en esta fase. Aunque los primeros experimentos suelen ser bastante deprimentes para los emprendedores, hay que intentar no pivotar como un pollo sin cabeza.El objetivo más importante de una start-up en esta etapa es conseguir el ajuste producto-mercado, que no se trata de construir el producto correcto sino de construir un modelo de negocio que funciona y es escalable.Hay que intentar maximizar el aprendizaje obtenido por unidad de tiempo acerca de los riesgos más importantes. El punto inicial es un diseño de un modelo de negocio, que creemos que, en caso de resultar ciertas todas las hipótesis que en él incluyo, tal vez me permita crear un negocio rentable. Para ello, poco a poco, iré llevando a cabo experimentos que van validando los diferentes componentes de cada una de las cajas del modelo de negocio.Los primeros experimentos irán dirigidos a entender el problema en profundidad. Llevaremos a cabo entrevistas con clientes potenciales, y aplicaremos técnicas de observación para entender si el problema que intentamos solucionar es un problema que merezca la pena intentar solucionar. Entre otros aspectos deberemos entender cómo de severo es el problema, si el cliente es consciente de que tiene ese problema y si está dispuesto a actuar para resolver ese problema. También deberemos entender cómo solucionan el problema a día de hoy. Y también intentaremos obtener_información acerca de que segmentos de cliente sufren con más intensidad ese problema.En una siguiente etapa, a partir del conocimiento generado en la etapa previa, definiremos la solución, construiremos una demo que ayude al cliente a visualizar y entender en qué consiste la misma, y la testearemos con los clientes. En esta etapa tengo que conseguir entender si la solución funciona y si los clientes perciben que soluciona su problema de forma eficiente. También deberemos identificar quiénes van a ser nuestros early-adopters.La siguiente etapa consiste en validar cualitativamente. Deberé construir un Producto Mínimo Viable y hacer un lanzamiento suave entre los early-adopters. En esta etapa trataremos de determinar si entienden y valoran la propuesta de valor. También es importante ir creando una base de early-adopters que me vayan ayudando a validar el producto a medida que lo voy evolucionando.La última etapa consiste en verificar cuantitativamente .Lanzaré el producto evolucionado a partir del conocimiento generado previamente a una audiencia mayor. El objetivo de esta etapa es entender si hemos construido algo que verdaderamente la gente necesita. También es muy importante empezar entendiendo cómo voy a conseguir clientes de forma escalable y si voy a poder realmente crear un negocio viable.Desde el punto de vista de los riesgos está primera fase me ayudará a:Riesgo de producto<ul><li>crear el producto adecuado</li></ul><li>asegurar que tenemos identificado un problema que merece la pena solucionar</li><li>definir la solución más pequeña posible (Producto Mínimo Viable)</li><li>construir el Producto Mínimo Viable que me permita hacer una demostración de la propuesta de valor</li><li>verificar todo ello de de forma que escale</li></ul>Riesgo de clientes<ul><li>construir un camino a los clientes</li></ul><li>identificar quién tiene el dolor</li><li>identificar quiénes son los early-adopters que necesitan mi producto ahora</li><li>llegar a los primeros clientes a través de canales outbound.</li><li>ir construyendo gradualmente canales inbound (cuanto antes mejor)</li></ul>Riesgo de mercado<ul><li>identificar la competencia y las posibles alternativas y elegir un precio para mi solución</li></ul><li>definir los precios viendo lo que dicen los clientes sobre ellos</li><li>testear los precios viendo lo que hacen los clientes</li><li>optimizar la estructura de costes para que funcione el modelo de negocio</li></ul>

- ### La forma más rápida de aprender es hablar con los clientes potenciales. No publicar código, ni recopilar métricas, si no hablar con gente. La mejor forma de conseguirlo es llevar a cabo entrevistas de clientes.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___No surveys or focus groups.md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Para diseñar una encuesta se supone que tienes que saber las preguntas que debes hacer, pero en las primeras etapas del ciclo de vida de una empresa esto no es así, sino que el objetivo de las primeras encuestas es explorar aquello “que no se que no se”. No sólo es probable que no sepa todavía las preguntas adecuadas, sino que tampoco se cuales son las respuestas adecuadas, lo cual me llevaría a que la mayor parte de las respuestas acaben en apartados como 'otros'.Por ello la mejor forma de empezar es con conversaciones desestructuradas y preguntas abiertas.Es muy importante además interactuar con los clientes de forma directa y es algo que deben hacer en persona los fundadores, ya que estas interacciones dan mucha más_información a través de los gestos y lenguaje no verbal de los clientes. Como dice Reid Hoffman, fundador de LinkedIn, 'no puedes intuir que un negocio va a funcionar hasta que no ves las pupilas de un cliente potencial dilatarse'.Siempre es preferible que las entrevistas sean cara a cara, ya que como hemos comentado el lenguaje no verbal puede ayudarnos a sacar muchas conclusiones útiles. Además facilitará que las personas entrevistadas empaticen con los emprendedores y le sigan ayudando más adelante.Los focus groups tampoco son una buena idea, ya que generan un entorno muy artificial que no invita a pensar fuera de la caja.Aunque las encuestas no son muy útiles en el aprendizaje inicial, pueden ser muy efectivas para verificar lo que ha aprendido a través de las entrevistas de los clientes. Tras llevar a cabo la validación cualitativa con las entrevistas entonces sí podré articular y diseñar un formulario que me ayude a verificar cuantitativamente el aprendizaje que obtenido y las hipótesis que incluyo en mi modelo de negocio. El objetivo no es tanto aprender cosas nuevas como demostrar la escalabilidad de los de las conclusiones a las que llegado.El principio de salir del edificio que propone Steve Blank, es una práctica, que aunque parezca sencilla en un principio, es difícil de ejecutar correctamente. Muchas veces de forma inconsciente nos cuesta hablar con los clientes. Creo que tiene mucho que ver con que somos conscientes de que podemos llevarnos una decepción. En el fondo es bastante parecido a ligar. Además muchas veces las primeras entrevistas no parecen productivas.Es muy importante entender que los resultados de las entrevistas no siempre son objetivos. Para empezar mucha gente miente, o directamente contesta lo primero que le pase por la cabeza, aunque no sepa que está diciendo. De igual forma, hay gente que no contará todo lo que le pasa por la cabeza para no dar un disgusto al emprendedor que tiene delante con los ojos inyectados en ilusión. También existe todo lo contrario, gente que desde el primer momento intentará sacar todo lo malo que le venga a la cabeza y gozará viéndote tragar saliva.Una cosa importante que seguramente descubriremos es que muchas veces, si se plantea un argumento lógico por el cual un cliente debe comprar un producto, es posible que te digan que, efectivamente, lo comprarían, aunque es bien sabido que los consumidores no siempre se comportan de forma racional ni mucho menos.Una vez entendemos el problema y la solución es importante empezar a medir que hacen los clientes y cómo se comportan. Por ejemplo, si un cliente declara que un problema es muy relevante para él, intenta indagar más, por ejemplo preguntándole cómo resuelve el problema día de hoy. Si no está resolviendo el problema de alguna manera, seguramente el problema no sea tan grave como declara. Si en cambio está solucionando el problema con el producto de un competidor con el que no está contento, o de alguna forma que hay inventado el, puede ser una señal de que el problema merece la pena ser resuelto.Otra táctica interesante es hacer una llamada a la acción. Si un cliente declara que pagaría un precio determinado por un producto, invítale a que pague una reserva del producto por ejemplo. Que se moje. Como dicen los anglosajones: “put your money where your mouth is”.También es importante ser el disciplinado y llevar a cabo las entrevistas de forma ordenada, sobre todo a medida que vamos pasando de generar conocimiento a verificar las conclusiones.Aunque lo más eficiente es identificar un segmento de early-adopters, no es mala idea entrevistar también otros segmentos de clientes. A veces uno se lleva sorpresa. Unos emprendedores con los que hablé, que vendían comida preparada por internet, descubrieron casualmente que sus early-adopters podían ser adultos con padres mayores que se pasaban la tarde del domingo cocinando en casa de sus padres, en vez de paseando con ellos. Una buena idea es empezar las entrevistas de clientes con gente que conozcas. Esto te ayudará a entrenar y mejorar la forma en que puedes llevar a cabo estas entrevistas, además de conseguir que esas personas conocidas que puedan poner en contacto con más clientes potenciales a los que puedas entrevistar.Otra buena idea es, siempre que sea posible, llevar a cabo las entrevistas en equipo, es decir más de una persona, simplemente por el hecho de que a nosotros se nos puede pasar cosas por alto detalles que sean relevantes.Un aspecto importante es intentar que las entrevistas tengan lugar en un sitio neutral como una cafetería. Esto facilita que el tono de la entrevista sea más casual y ayuda a empatizar con el emprendedor. La misma entrevista en una cafetería o en una sala de reuniones de una oficina, es muy distinta. En cuanto a duración de las entrevistas, suelen durar entre 15 y 30 minutos.Si es posible, las entrevistas deberán ser presenciales. Si no es posible, o si es más cómodo para el entrevistado, se pueden hacer en remoto mediante videoconferencia, por ejemplo con Google Hangouts o skype.No es buena idea pagar porque entrevistas, ya que lo que estamos intentando validar es el interés de nuestro público objetivo, y esto se distorsiona obviamente si hay un incentivo económico. Por ejemplo, si me pagaran lo suficiente, yo estaría dispuesto a decir que me parece una buena idea vender dispensadores de caramelos PEZ con la cara de Justin Bieber.No tiene sentido grabar las entrevistas, aunque en un primer momento pueda parecer muy lógico. En realidad no vas a tener tiempo de escucharlas una segunda vez, y además puede que los entrevistados se sientan en poco menos libres en sus comentarios.En cuanto termine la entrevista es una buena idea documentar las conclusiones de la misma sin que pase demasiado tiempo. Suele ser suficiente llevar a cabo entrevistas con entorno a 50 personas en el primer mes. Es útil hacer entrevistas hasta el momento en el que uno se da cuenta de que no aprenden nada nuevo. Es decir cuando tus predicciones sobre las respuestas y comentarios que van a tener son acertadas a priori. Es decir, cuando te sientas como Phil en el Día de La Marmota de Punxstawnwey.Si las entrevistas se conciertan de antemano de antemano, es importante pensar en el proceso a seguir para organizar las mismas sin volverse loco gestionando la agenda.

- ### Lo ideal es encontrar clientes potenciales a los que entrevistar a través de un canal que me pueda servir para obtener clientes en un futuro, pero no siempre es posible. Por ello hay que aprovechar cualquier canal disponible para conseguir estos potenciales entrevistados, aunque no sea óptimo ni escalable.Puedes comenzar con tus contactos de primer grado, es decir con personas a las que conozcas de forma directa, que estén dentro del segmento de clientes al que te diriges. Los resultados de las entrevistas que se llevan a cabo con personas conocidas deben ser interpretados con prudencia, ya que existe la posibilidad de que sean sesgados debido a la relación previa existente ¿De verdad crees que tu madre te va a decir que tu proyecto de vender figuritas de anime hechas con manzanas esculpidas es una estupidez?También hay que pedirles que te presenten a personas que conozcan y que respondan al perfil que estás buscando. Es buena idea ponérselo fácil con un correo que puedan reenviar, o un mensaje de facebook o whatsapp.No tengas reparo en pedir entrevistas a gente que no conoces. Si te presentas como un emprendedor que tiene una idea de negocio y que está intentando validar que tiene sentido antes de lanzarse al barro, generalmente la gente empatiza contigo y va a querer ayudarte. A mi me ha funcionado en múltiples ocasiones en las que no hubiera apostado un céntimo a que me iban a prestar la más mínima atención.Otra forma buena de conseguir clientes potenciales que entrevistar, es creando, cuanto antes, un sitio web que refleje la propuesta de valor e incluya un formulario para que puedan dejar sus datos de contacto las personas interesadas.Una buena forma de romper el hielo también es generando un contenido que motive a la persona a dedicar tiempo a interactuar contigo. Por ejemplo si tu proyecto va dirigido a diseñadores de moda, puedes abrir un blog en el que el incluyes entrevistas por videoconferencia a diseñadores, con lo cual la propuesta que les haces es que les quieres entrevistar y además les estarías muy agradecido si te pudieran dedicar unos minutos posteriormente para la entrevista de validación.Empieza cuanto antes a llevar a cabo entrevistas. Un error habitual es sobre trabajar las entrevistas y posponerlas hasta que todo esté perfectamente organizado. Muchas veces este comportamiento responde al miedo de salir a hablar con clientes y es una forma de autoengañarse.Haz pruebas rápidas de contactar dientes por diferentes canales que se te ocurran. Dedica una mañana intenta contactarles por e-mail, otra distinta a intentar contactarles con una llamada en frío, otra distinta a intentar contactarles a través de LinkedIn y otra a través de Twitter. Mide todo para ver cuál es la forma más eficiente de contactar a tus clientes potenciales.Lo mejor es hacer una lista de clientes potenciales y ordenarla en función de lo importantes que sean para ti. Una vez tengas ordenada lista empieza a contactar a los clientes potenciales menos atractivos y vete sacando conclusiones para ir mejorando este proceso de contacto (y practicando tus habilidades de comunicación) de forma que cuando llegues a los más importantes hayas aprendido la mejor forma de plantear la invitación a la entrevista.

- ### Muchas veces no lo es porque el resultado de las entrevistas no es claramente interpretable y se queda entre dos aguas sin facilitar que llegues a conclusiones claras. Pero también es cierto que algunas otras veces ayuda a invalidar o validar hipótesis de forma rotunda, por ejemplo si todos los entrevistados que pertenecen al segmento de clientes te dicen que no pagarían el precio que has fijado para el producto.

- ### En realidad el empezar a validar cualitativamente te va a permitir atinar mucho más a la hora de establecer métricas cuantitativas. De igual forma, te va a ayudar a interpretar esas medidas cuantitativas.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___I belong to the customer segment..md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Conozco perfectamente el segmento de clientes al que me dirijo por lo que no hace falta que hable con más gente. Este es uno de los problemas más comunes en startups que fracasan. Es muy habitual que un emprendedor creé un proyecto que resuelve una necesidad que él sufren de forma especialmente intensa, y que proyecte esa necesidad en un mercado amplísimo que en realidad no la tiene.

- ### Claro. Seguro que la vecina que lleva colada por ti desde primaria te ha dado muy buen feedback. Está muy bien hablar con amigos en un primer momento para ir dando forma las entrevistas e ir practicando, pero hay que ser muy prudente ya que sus opiniones son sesgadas.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Instead of talking to clients, I am going to create the product..md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### El estado de la tecnología hace que muchas de las ideas que pueda tener un emprendedor sean muy fáciles y sencillas de implementar en muy poco tiempo, por lo que parece lógico realizar un pequeño esfuerzo en construirlo directamente, para ver luego si se vende o no. Muchas veces los emprendedores se basan en argumentos como éste, porque en realidad lo más estimulante es empezar a construir el producto, lo cual está bien si quieres aprender o practicar un nuevo lenguaje de programación por ejemplo, pero no es lo más inteligente si lo que quieres crear es un negocio. Por ejemplo, para tener algo que mostrar a clientes potenciales no hace falta que que esté funcionando una aplicación, sino que generalmente es suficiente con algunos diseños de pantallas.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___I don't need to test the problem, it's obvious.md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### En ocasiones hay problemas que claramente tiene sentido resolver (por ejemplo una enfermedad grave, o aumentar las ventas de una empresa), por lo que no es necesario llevar a cabo tantas entrevistas de clientes. En estos casos lo que nos pueden brindar las entrevistas a los clientes potenciales, es entender en profundidad los matices del problema e identificar cómo perciben ese problema los distintos segmentos de clientes.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___If I conduct customer interviews, they will steal the idea..md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### En un primer momento las entrevistas se centran en el problema, por lo que no tienes porque dar demasiadas pistas acerca de cómo piensa solucionarlo. Además si estás entrevistando a tus público objetivo es mucho más probable que muestren más interés en adquirir tu solución una vez esté disponible, que en montar una empresa para copiarte. Por otro lado, lamento comunicarte que es, cuanto menos, poco probable que seas el elegido por un ser superior para otorgarte una idea de que vaya a cambiar el destino de la humanidad. Lo más probable es que esa misma idea la hayan tenido ya otras muchas personas.

page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Es absurdo hacer entrevistas a clientes potenciales sin tener el producto listo, ya que puede ser que tras la entrevista quieran comprar mi producto, y que todavía no está disponible. El verdadero riesgo es que en construyas el producto y nadie quiera comprarlo.

Estamos pensando en crear un producto para resolver este problema pero antes de hacerlo queremos chequear con nuestro público objetivo que la idea tiene sentido, que el problema que hemos identificado es un problema que merece la pena ser resuelto y que el producto que queremos construir puede ser útil.La entrevista va a funcionar de la siguiente forma. Voy a empezar describiendo los principales problemas que hemos identificado y después te preguntaré qué piensas de cada uno de ellos.

page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Semanalmente hay que revisar los resultados y empezar a **sacar conclusiones**. Es posible que nos demos cuenta de que tenemos que **cambiar algo en el formulario** de la entrevista. Es una buena práctica someter los documentos asociados a las entrevistas a un **control de versiones** indicando si es la versión 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, etc... cuando se introduzcan cambios. También es habitual darse cuenta de que es útil para entender los problemas diseñar **formularios ligeramente distintos para cada segmento** de clientes.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Problem interviews___Start identifying the early adopters (Problem Interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Intenta identificar qué segmentos de clientes son más favorables, es decir tienen mayor resonancia del problema. También debes empezar a descartar segmentos menos favorables.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Problem interviews___Refine the problems (Problem interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Si percibes una señal de 'no lo necesito' para un problema concreto elimina ese problema. De igual forma, si descubres un nuevo problema del que te hablan la mayor parte de los clientes, pero que no habías identificado previamente, añadelo al modelo de negocio y al formulario. Idealmente el objetivo de todas estas entrevistas, es identificar el problema que sea absolutamente necesario resolver desde el punto de vista de tus clientes.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Problem interviews___Understand in depth the existing alternatives (Problem interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Esto es fundamental para diseñar el producto correcto. Los early-adopters van a usar sus alternativas existentes como un ancla respecto al cual van a juzgar tu solución, precio, y posicionamiento. Así que, por ejemplo, si todas las alternativas existentes son gratuitas, tu producto debe ser percibido como de valor suficiente como para pagar por él, cuando existen alternativas que no cuestan dinero.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Problem interviews___Pay attention to the words that customers use (Problem interviews).md

innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___The demo has to seem real (Solution interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### En ocasiones se ponen delante de los clientes diseños como esqueletos, wire-frames o sketches que, aunque son rápidos de construir, requieren que el cliente realice un esfuerzo grande para entenderlos, ya que se parecen poco al producto final. Por ello cuanto más real parezca tu demo, más adecuadamente podrás probar tu solución.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___The demo should be easy to modify (Solution interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### En cuanto pongas la demo delante de los primeros clientes a los que realices las entrevistas de solución, vas a sacar conclusiones muy rápidamente, que deberás incorporar a la demo y probar en las entrevistas siguientes. Es por ello que no suele ser una buena idea subcontratar la construcción de la demo, si no aprender a realizarla tu mismo. Aunque no estés familiarizado con las herramientas necesarias para construir tu demo, puedes aprender rápidamente a utilizarlas.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___The demo should minimize waste (Solution interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### La creación de una demo conlleva un esfuerzo en coste y dinero que no deja de ser un desperdicio, en el sentido en que muchas veces no se incorpora al producto final. Por ello, si es posible, es una buena práctica intentar construir la demo con tecnologías y herramientas que se puedan aprovechar a la hora de construir el producto final.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___The demo should use data that appears real (Solution interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### No uses datos tontos (por ejemplo loren ipsums, fotos de perfiles,etc.) sino datos que parezcan reales para explicar en qué consiste el producto.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___Test the price (Solution interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### En muchas ocasiones, en las entrevistas de solución, si les preguntes a los clientes acerca del precio que estarían dispuestos a pagar, no tendrán la más mínima idea. Y además se sentirán incómodos. Es difícil convencer a un cliente de que tiene un problema, pero a menudo es posible convencerles de que paguen un precio por el producto.Hay que evitar una reacción muy natural en los emprendedores, de rebajar los precios para disminuir la fricción del comienzo del uso. Es muy habitual que queramos hacer tan fácil como sea posible que los clientes digan si a nuestro producto y comiencen a usarlo, esperando que el valor que les entregamos a lo largo del tiempo les convenza de pagar un precio determinado. Esta es una estrategia muy peligrosa ya que retrasa la verdadera validación del negocio. Uno de los aspectos más importantes a validar es el compromiso de los clientes con el producto.Recuerda que tu objetivo es encontrar early-adopters que sean apasionados de tu producto y que estén dispuestos a pagar un precio justo. Recordemos que el precio no es sólo parte de nuestro producto, sino que además define el segmento de clientes al que nos dirigimos.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___Do not decrease friction, increase it (Solution interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Soy consciente de que esto puede ser contra intuitivo, pero si has llevado a cabo correctamente el análisis del problema, podrás justificar por qué tiene sentido económico para ellos el precio de tu solución. Esto te ayudará a identificar aquellos clientes que sienten el problema de forma más severa. Aunque a veces nos cuesta un poco creer creérnoslo a nosotros mismos, tenemos que hacer ver a los clientes que participar en una etapa temprana de nuestro producto como early-adopters es una oportunidad, lo que significa darle la vuelta al típico discurso de venta.Una de las estrategias que puedes seguir es hacer ver que hay una escasez para participar en esta fase como cliente. Puedes comunicar claramente que no estás tratando en este momento de vender el mal el máximo número de unidades posibles, sino de encontrar los 10 clientes que más se ajusten al perfil de lo que estás buscando, para darles una especial atención e incorporar su feedback al producto.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___Trust (Solution Interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Muchos emprendedores son reacios a cobrar por su Producto Mínimo Viable porque entienden que es demasiado mínimo, y en ocasiones hasta les da vergüenza. Recordemos en este aspecto las palabras de Reid Hoffman, fundador de LinkedIn, 'si la primera versión de tu producto no te avergüenza, es que has lanzado demasiado tarde'. Si has hecho las cosas bien verás en tu Producto Mínimo Viable algo que soluciona un verdadero problema para un segmento de clientes.

- ### En las entrevistas de solución entrevistaremos a los early-adopters que ya hemos entrevistado en las entrevistas de problema, y también deberemos incluir nuevos prospectos, que afronten la entrevista de cero sin ningún conocimiento previo. Al igual que previamente, las entrevistas de solución también nos ayudan a probar canales para llegar a nuestros clientes.El guión de la entrevista de solución que proponemos es el siguiente:


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___Solution Interview - Welcome (Solution Interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Definir el escenario (dos minutos)“Muchas gracias por dedicarnos tu tiempo. Estamos trabajando en un servicio de compartición de videos y fotos dirigido a padres. La idea surgió cuando nos dimos cuenta de que las soluciones actuales son frustrantes. La entrevista va a tener la siguiente estructura. Voy a empezar describiendo los problemas que hemos identificado y te preguntaré que te parecen. Posteriormente se enseñaré una demo del producto. Quiero recalcar que el objetivo de esta reunión es aprender y validar algunas de las ideas que tengo en la cabeza, no vender ningún producto,. De hecho el producto no está terminado.”

innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___Solution Interview - Tell a story (Solution Interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Establece el contexto del problema (dos minutos)“Déjame contarte acerca de los problemas que estamos intentando resolver. Cuando tenemos hijos hacemos muchas fotos constantemente, al igual que videos. También tenemos solicitudes frecuentes de los abuelos y otros miembros de la familia para que compartamos con ellos estas fotos y videos. El proceso de compartir estas fotos y vdeos es demasiado intensivo en tiempo. Tenemos que organizar los ficheros, editarlos y estar presentes durante el proceso de subida al al servidor que utilicemos. Con el video, a veces tenemos que convertirlo otros formatos. Si a esto sumamos que como padres tenemos menos tiempo que antes de tener hijos y valoramos mucho más nuestro tiempo libre, preferiríamos emplear nuestro tiempo en otras cosas. ¿Te suena estos esta situación?”Lo lógico sería que a la mayor parte de las personas a las que entrevistes en entrevistas de solución reconozcan que efectivamente es un problema que tienen. Si no fuera así, tal vez deberíamos volver a pensar si estamos resolviendo un problema adecuado.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___Demo (Solution Interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Enseña la solución (15 minutos)Esta es la parte más importante de la entrevista. Describiremos cada problema y mostraremos al entrevistado como lo solucionamos utilizando la demo, haciendo pausas al final y solicitando al entrevistado que nos comente sus impresiones. Posteriormente le preguntaremos que parte de la demo le ha llamado más la atención y si cree que hay características que podría ser interesante incorporar al producto.


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___Test the prices (Solution interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Líneas de ingresos (tres minutos)Encontrar el precio justo es más un arte que una ciencia. Por lo general el precio adecuado es aquel que el cliente acepta, pero con un poco de resistencia. Probaremos nuestra política de precios utilizando como referencia el que hayamos determinado para este segmento de clientes. En este caso podemos hacer dos cosas:<ul><li>Plantearle el precio de forma directamente y analizar su respuesta y si lo acepta si lo ve claro o si ha tenido dudas.</li></ul><li>Preguntarle tres precios: el que considera adecuado para la solución, el precio a partir del cual consideraría caro el producto, y el precio a partir del cual consideraría barato el producto.</li></ul>


innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___Close the solution interview (Solution interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Solicita permiso para involucrarle en el proyecto y solicitar referenciasLes indicaremos que la entrevista ha terminado y les preguntaremos si están interesados en que les contratemos más adelante cuando en la solución esté lista. Si es posible, habría que intentar conseguir un compromiso más allá de una afirmación verbal. Además les pediremos referencias, es decir, si nos pueden poner en contacto con personas de su mismo perfil.

- ### ¿Qué conclusiones sacas de las reacciones que han tenido los entrevistados cuando les has hablado el precio del producto?. Si no han mostrado ninguna resistencia al precio que has planteado a lo mejor puedes probar con un precio superior. Además hay que tener siempre en cuenta las soluciones alternativas y sus precios. Analiza también si los precios que has validado te van a permitir crear un negocio viable y sostenible y rentable.

- ### Se trata de realizar interacciones rápidas con mis clientes para ir construyendo versiones incrementales de mi producto que me permitan validar que voy por el buen camino al ponerlas enfrente de nuestros clientes.En la forma tradicional de afrontar el desarrollo de un producto la mayor parte del aprendizaje tiene lugar durante la toma de requisitos inicial y una vez se realiza la entrega del producto y los clientes comienzan a usarlos. Es muy importante huir de esta aproximación, mediante la cual construimos un producto perfecto, con todas las características que podría desear un usuario y meses e incluso años más tarde sacamos una primera versión.[presentación de MVP]Lo primero es diseñar nuestro Producto Mínimo Viable de forma que incluya sólo las características que son totalmente necesarias para resolver los problemas que hemos detectado que tienen nuestros clientes. Cuanto más ligera sea la primera versión del Producto Mínimo Viable, más rápido podremos lanzarlo y ponerlo delante de nuestros clientes para validar que vamos por el camino correcto.

- ### Tienes que ir a toda pastilla. No pierdas tiempo en optimizar nada. Simplemente construye las cosas de forma que funcionen y punto ¿Pero qué pasa si me llueven los pedidos? Francamente eso es poco probable, y ya tendrás tiempo de resolverlo en caso de que así sea. Si tienes un problema de escalado, ya serás capaz de resolverlo (seguramente de una forma ineficiente y relativamente chapucera).

- ### Los materiales de marketing son una de las principales formas a través de las que vas hacer llegar tu propuesta de valor a los clientes potenciales. Veamos cómo crear una página web que transmita la propuesta de forma eficiente (aunque aplica también a otros materiales como folletos, anuncios en prensa, anuncios en televisión, etc...)Para entender cómo deben funcionar los materiales de marketing, describiremos un embudo en el que van entrando oportunidades en forma de clientes desinformados, y a través del proceso de ventas se va convirtiendo un porcentaje de ellos en clientes que pagan. También se definen hitos intermedios que sitúan a los prospectos más o menos cerca del evento final de venta. Cada canal tiene su embudo propio.El objetivo de nuestra página web es conseguir que los visitantes se conviertan en prospectos interesados. Y todo ello rápidamente,. No esperes que tus clientes dediquen demasiado tiempo a leer en tu página . Por eso es importante tener la propuesta de valor bien destilada, ya que es el punto de partida para generar curiosidad y que sigan_informando se acerca a nuestro producto.

- ### Debe plasmar y comunicar de forma eficiente la propuesta de valor que estamos intentando probar. De hecho puedes hacer distintas páginas de aterrizaje para distintas propuestas de valor que quieras testear.

Humaniza todo lo que sea posible la misma y aporta datos del equipo fundador: fotos, enlaces a los perfiles de LinkedIn, etc. No caigas en el error de hacer una página “sobre nosotros” acomplejada y anodina. Digo acomplejada porque es frecuente encontrarse con páginas de startups que son un quiero y no puedo, y utilizan un lenguaje imitando al de las grandes corporaciones: ' somos una empresa joven y dinámica pero de sobrada experiencia cuyo objetivo es superar de forma constante las expectativas de nuestros clientes ofreciendo soluciones integrales blablablá'.

Esto siempre es preferible a otros medios como correo electrónico, foros o paneles de discusión.Detalles, como contactar a los clientes proactivamente para interesarse por el uso que están haciendo de tu producto, contratar un número ofrecer un número gratuito de contacto telefónico, demuestran a los clientes que te preocupas por ellos.

- ### Permitir a un cliente probar tu producto antes de comprarlo, y siempre que puedas hacerlo en función del tipo de producto servicio vendes, es una buena idea. No sólo supone una forma de generar clientes de pago, sino también una fuente excelente de aprendizajeEl primer objetivo de las pruebas de clientes, es reducir la tasa de abandono en la adquisición y activación. El siguiente objetivo es incrementar la retención y el enganche, conseguir pagos (si aplica), y obtener testimonios de clientes favorables.El objetivo debería ser conseguir que un porcentaje notable de mis early-adoptpers complete el ciclo. Ash Maurya plantea que sea el 80%. El mundo es de los valientes. En cualquier caso lo importante es entender que este porcentaje será muy superior al que tengamos en la cabeza cuando el negocio esté funcionando a velocidad de crucero, ya que, con todas las ocasiones en las que has hablado con ellos, esperemos que hayas sido capaz de generar un interés especial

Hasta el tipo más aburrido del mundo tiene de vez en cuando cosas que hacer y se distrae, y un recordatorio te puede ayudar a que dirija de nuevo su atención a tu producto.En realidad más que enviar correos en función del tiempo que ha pasado desde que el usuario se ha registrado, es mejor pensar que correos le vas enviar en función del la etapa ciclo de vida en el que se encuentra. Por ejemplo si un usuario se estanca en la fase de activación, en vez de enviarle_información acerca de las características super avanzadas de tu producto, tiene más sentido que le envíes una guía de problemas frecuentes.

innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___Learn and pivot (Solution interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Pivotar es la acción de introducir algún cambio relevante en el modelo de negocio, generalmente como consecuencia de qué alguna hipótesis importante no ha sido validada y ha probado no ser cierta en un experimento..

En ocasiones el alcance el cambio es limitado y se puede considerar que el negocio que continúa es el mismo, y en ocasiones el cambio es totalmente radical e implica dirigirse a nuevos clientes resolviendo un problema totalmente distinto con una solución que se parece como un huevo a una castaña a la inicialmente pensada..

Es muy habitual que un pivote sea consecuencia de que una startup ha creado su modelo de negocio inicial tratando de ofrecer una solución universal para todos los problemas del mundo, pero que en algún momento se han dado cuenta de que, si quieren tener éxito, lo que tienen que hacer es ser los mejores haciendo una sola cosa muy bien..

Algunos ejemplos de startup que han pivotado pueden ser:.

Instagram, la conocida aplicación para compartir fotos a través del móvil, que antes de convertirse en lo que son ahora eran una especie de Foursquare que geolocalizaba a los clientes y les permitía hacer check-in en sitios a los que entraban..

Otro ejemplo de pivote es el que lleva a cabo YouTube, que antes de convertirse en la plataforma de vídeo online de facto en Internet, comenzó siendo una página para encontrar pareja a través de videos..

PayPal comenzó siendo un proyecto que permitía intercambiar dinero a través de las Palm Pilot, hasta que Peter Thiel, uno de sus fundadores, vio mucho más potencial en resolver un problema mucho más grande: la necesidad de disponer de una forma fácil de transferir dinero online..

Flickr es otro ejemplo the startup que pivotó. Al principio comenzó siendo un juego de rol online hasta que se dieron cuenta de que era mucho más interesante solucionar el problema de encontrar una forma fácil para compartir fotos en Internet..

Groupon por ejemplo empezó siendo una plataforma de activismo ciudadano.

Shopify empezó siendo una tienda online para aficionados al snowboard, pero cuando descubrieron lo complicado que era crear una web de comercio electrónico decidieron escribir su plataforma propia y ofrecerla como solución a empresas pequeñas que tuvieran el mismo problema.

Twitter surgió de la empresa Odeo, que era un directorio de podcasts que dejó de tener sentido cuando salió iTunes, y decidieron centrarse en el desarrollo de Twitter, un side project que convirtieron en su producto principal..

Describiremos cómo la persona conoce el producto lo compra y lo usa.

Cómo determina el usuario final que tiene una necesidad de tu producto?

Cómo lo compra?

Cómo lo paga?

Hay que ver el proceso desde el punto de vista del cliente.

Evitar sobreestimar el entusiasmo que los clientes tiene con tu producto.

Esto ayuda a evitar percepciones erróneas en el equipo acerca de la solución que estamos creando.

Si estamos cenando un software o sitio web describiremos los flujos de usuario entre una pantalla y otra, si se trata de hardware puede servir un diagrama, etc...

No se debe entrar en detalles de bajo nivel y distraerse demasiado en este paso.

La diferencia entre el valor que recibe con el estado actual de las cosas y el que recibiría usando tu producto es la propuesta cuantificada de valor.

Busca una frase que plasme tu propuesta de valor, y genera un diagrama comparando el estado actual con el posible si usarán tu producto.

Intenta ser prudente con las cifras, ya que si no perderás credibilidad. Intenta prometer menos menos y entregar más.

Se trata de validar que se ha encontrado una oportunidad escalable no una solución para un cliente.

Los 10 clientes deben encajar en el perfil de usuario final, y se intentará validar todo el trabajo realizado hasta ahora.

Disminuir la incertidumbre y estaremos más confiados en que el negocio es viable.

En algunos casos se les puede pedir que firme en una carta de intenciones, o incluso pagar una pre-reserva.

No se deben sacar conclusiones de entrevistas individuales, sino identificar patrones.

Si no eres capaz de conseguir 10 potenciales clientes, es una posible señal de que debes cambiar tu mercado desembarco.

Comprobar cómo encaja mi producto con las principales prioridades de la persona.

Cómo los productos existentes se ajustan a las prioridades de la persona en comparación con mi producto.

Analizar si hay coherencia entre la oportunidad de mercado, mi esencia y las prioridades de mi persona.

Hay que entender quién va a tomar la última decisión de compra de mi producto y quién le va a animar a hacerlo.

Es habitual que en una decisión de compra esté involucrada más de una persona, por lo que es importante entender el rol de cada uno de ellos y sus intereses.

Ya tenemos cierto nivel de confianza en que nuestra persona de usuario final va a obtener valor de nuestro producto y que nuestra oferta es única, y ahora nos centraremos en validar que nuestra persona de usuario final y nuestros 10 siguientes clientes puedan comprar nuestro producto.

La estructura de precios puede tener un impacto gigante en los resultados de la empresa.

page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### El coste no debe ser un factor a la hora de establecer los precios.

Hay que pensar cómo se reparte el valor generado entre el cliente y nosotros. Un punto de referencia es quedarnos con el 20% del valor generado. Depende también del riesgo que esté asumiendo el cliente al comprar nuestro producto.

No compartas tus cifras de costes con nadie que no las necesite.

Utiliza la Unidad Económica de Decisión y el Proceso para adquirir un cliente que pague para identificar los puntos de referencia de precios. Entiende los precios de las alternativas que tiene el cliente.

Diferentes tipos de clientes pagarán diferentes precios. Por ejemplo, los perfiles marcados por la curva de adopción de las innovaciones.

Se flexible con los precios para los primeros probadores del producto. Siempre es más fácil bajar el precio que subirlo.
